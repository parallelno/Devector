.SH NAME
SDL_PROP_GLOBAL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_WL_DISPLAY_POINTER \- The pointer to the global
.BR wl_display
object used by the Wayland video backend\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_PROP_GLOBAL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_WL_DISPLAY_POINTER "SDL.video.wayland.wl_display"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Can be set before the video subsystem is initialized to import an external
.BR wl_display
object from an application or toolkit for use in SDL, or read
after initialization to export the
.BR wl_display
used by the Wayland video
backend\[char46] Setting this property after the video subsystem has been
initialized has no effect, and reading it when the video subsystem is
uninitialized will either return the user provided value, if one was set
prior to initialization, or NULL\[char46] See docs/README-wayland\[char46]md for more
information\[char46]
