.SH DESCRIPTION
This string is used by desktop compositors to identify and group windows
together, as well as match applications with associated desktop settings
and icons\[char46]

On Wayland this corresponds to the "app ID" window property and on X11 this
corresponds to the WM_CLASS property\[char46] Windows inherit the value of this
hint at creation time\[char46] Changing this hint after a window has been created
will not change the app ID or class of existing windows\[char46]

For *nix platforms, this string should be formatted in reverse-DNS notation
and follow some basic rules to be valid:


\(bu The application ID must be composed of two or more elements separated by
  a period (\[char46]) character\[char46]

\(bu Each element must contain one or more of the alphanumeric characters
  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) plus underscore (_) and hyphen (-) and must not start
  with a digit\[char46] Note that hyphens, while technically allowed, should not be
  used if possible, as they are not supported by all components that use
  the ID, such as D-Bus\[char46] For maximum compatibility, replace hyphens with an
  underscore\[char46]

\(bu The empty string is not a valid element (ie: your application ID may not
  start or end with a period and it is not valid to have two periods in a
  row)\[char46]

\(bu The entire ID must be less than 255 characters in length\[char46]

Examples of valid app ID strings:


\(bu org\[char46]MyOrg\[char46]MyApp

\(bu com\[char46]your_company\[char46]your_app

Desktops such as GNOME and KDE require that the app ID string matches your
application's \[char46]desktop file name (e\[char46]g\[char46] if the app ID string is
'org\[char46]MyOrg\[char46]MyApp', your application's \[char46]desktop file should be named
'org\[char46]MyOrg\[char46]MyApp\[char46]desktop')\[char46]

If you plan to package your application in a container such as Flatpak, the
app ID should match the name of your Flatpak container as well\[char46]

If not set, SDL will attempt to use the application executable name\[char46] If the
executable name cannot be retrieved, the generic string
"
.BR SDL_App
" will be used\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
