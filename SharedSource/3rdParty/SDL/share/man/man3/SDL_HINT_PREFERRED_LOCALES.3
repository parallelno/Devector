SDL_HINT_PREFERRED_LOCALES \- Override for

()\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.nf

.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_PREFERRED_LOCALES "SDL_PREFERRED_LOCALES"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If set, this will be favored over anything the OS might report for the
user's preferred locales\[char46] Changing this hint at runtime will not generate a

.BR SDL_EVENT_LOCALE_CHANGED
 event (but if you can
change the hint, you can push your own event, if you want)\[char46]

The format of this hint is a comma-separated list of language and locale,
combined with an underscore, as is a common format: "en_GB"\[char46] Locale is
optional: "en"\[char46] So you might have a list like this: "en_GB,jp,es_PT"

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
