.SH NAME
SDL_UnregisterApp \- Deregister the win32 window class from an 
.BR SDL_RegisterApp
 call\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_UnregisterApp(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can be called to undo the effects of

.BR SDL_RegisterApp
\[char46]

Most applications do not need to, and should not, call this directly; SDL
will call it when deinitializing the video subsystem\[char46]

It is safe to call this multiple times, as long as every call is eventually
paired with a prior call to 
.BR SDL_RegisterApp
\[char46] The window
class will only be deregistered when the registration counter in

.BR SDL_RegisterApp
 decrements to zero through calls to this
function\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
