.SH DESCRIPTION
This sets the alpha channel of a transparent window and any fully
transparent areas are also transparent to mouse clicks\[char46] If you are using
something besides the SDL render API, then you are responsible for setting
the alpha channel of the window yourself\[char46]

your shape surface changes, you should call

.BR SDL_SetWindowShape
() again to update the window\[char46]

The window must have been created with the

.BR SDL_WINDOW_TRANSPARENT
 flag\[char46]

() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
