.SH NAME
SDL_CPUPauseInstruction \- A macro to insert a CPU-specific "pause" instruction into the program\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_atomic\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq

.BI "#define SDL_CPUPauseInstruction() DoACPUPauseInACompilerAndArchitectureSpecificWay
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can be useful in busy-wait loops, as it serves as a hint to the CPU as
to the program's intent; some CPUs can use this to do more efficient
processing\[char46] On some platforms, this doesn't do anything, so using this
macro might just be a harmless no-op\[char46]

Note that if you are busy-waiting, there are often more-efficient
approaches with other synchronization primitives: mutexes, semaphores,
condition variables, etc\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
This macro is safe to use from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
