.TH SDL_GetCameraPermissionState 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetCameraPermissionState \- Query if camera access has been approved by the user\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_camera\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetCameraPermissionState(SDL_Camera *camera);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Cameras will not function between when the device is opened by the app and
when the user permits access to the hardware\[char46] On some platforms, this
presents as a popup dialog where the user has to explicitly approve access;
on others the approval might be implicit and not alert the user at all\[char46]

This function can be used to check the status of that approval\[char46] It will
return 0 if still waiting for user response, 1 if the camera is approved
for use, and -1 if the user denied access\[char46]

Instead of polling with this function, you can wait for a

.BR SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_APPROVED
 (or

.BR SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_DENIED
) event in
the standard SDL event loop, which is guaranteed to be sent once when
permission to use the camera is decided\[char46]

If a camera is declined, there's nothing to be done but call

.BR SDL_CloseCamera
() to dispose of it\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I camera
the opened camera device to query
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns -1 if user denied access to the camera, 1 if user approved access,
0 if no decision has been made yet\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
