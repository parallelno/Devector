.SH NAME
SDL_WaitConditionTimeout \- Wait until a condition variable is signaled or a certain time has passed\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_WaitConditionTimeout(SDL_Condition *cond,
.BI "                        SDL_Mutex *mutex, Sint32 timeoutMS);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function unlocks the specified
.BR mutex
and waits for another thread to
call 
.BR SDL_SignalCondition
() or

.BR SDL_BroadcastCondition
() on the condition
variable
.BR cond
, or for the specified time to elapse\[char46] Once the condition
variable is signaled or the time elapsed, the mutex is re-locked and the
function returns\[char46]

The mutex must be locked before calling this function\[char46] Locking the mutex
recursively (more than once) is not supported and leads to undefined
behavior\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I cond
the condition variable to wait on
.TP
.I mutex
the mutex used to coordinate thread access
.TP
.I timeoutMS
the maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, or -1 to wait indefinitely
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 if the condition variable is signaled,

.BR
.BR SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT
if the condition is not signaled
in the allotted time, or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
