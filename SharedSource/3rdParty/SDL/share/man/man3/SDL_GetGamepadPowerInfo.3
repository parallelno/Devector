.PP
.BI "SDL_PowerState SDL_GetGamepadPowerInfo(SDL_Gamepad *gamepad, int *percent);

.SH DESCRIPTION
You should never take a battery status as absolute truth\[char46] Batteries
(especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports\[char46] It's
not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it
reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I gamepad
the gamepad object to query\[char46]
.TP
.I percent
a pointer filled in with the percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100, or NULL to ignore\[char46] This will be filled in with -1 we can't determine a value or there is no battery\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current battery state\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
