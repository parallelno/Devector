.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_SHUTDOWN_DBUS_ON_QUIT \- A variable controlling whether SDL calls dbus_shutdown() on quit\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_SHUTDOWN_DBUS_ON_QUIT "SDL_SHUTDOWN_DBUS_ON_QUIT"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is useful as a debug tool to validate memory leaks, but shouldn't ever
be set in production applications, as other libraries used by the
application might use dbus under the hood and this cause cause crashes if
they continue after 
.BR SDL_Quit
()\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": SDL will not call dbus_shutdown() on quit\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": SDL will call dbus_shutdown() on quit\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]
