.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If set, this _might_ increase framerate at the expense of the desktop not
working as expected\[char46] Override-redirect windows aren't noticed by the window
manager at all\[char46]

You should probably only use this for fullscreen windows, and you probably
shouldn't even use it for that\[char46] But it's here if you want to try!

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Do not mark the window as override-redirect\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Mark the window as override-redirect\[char46]

This hint should be set before creating a window\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
