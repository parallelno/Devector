.SH DESCRIPTION
This event is unique; it is never created by SDL, but only by the
application\[char46] The event can be pushed onto the event queue using

.BR SDL_PushEvent
()\[char46] The contents of the structure members are
completely up to the programmer; the only requirement is that '''type''' is
a value obtained from 
.BR SDL_RegisterEvents
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
