.SH NAME
SDL_OpenIO \- Create a custom 
.BR SDL_IOStream
\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_iostream\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_IOStream* SDL_OpenIO(const SDL_IOStreamInterface *iface, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Applications do not need to use this function unless they are providing
their own 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 implementation\[char46] If you just need an

.BR SDL_IOStream
 to read/write a common data source, you should
use the built-in implementations in SDL, like

.BR SDL_IOFromFile
() or 
.BR SDL_IOFromMem
(),
etc\[char46]

You must free the returned pointer with 
.BR SDL_CloseIO
()\[char46]

This function makes a copy of
.BR iface
and the caller does not need to keep
this data around after this call\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I iface
The function pointers that implement this 
.BR SDL_IOStream
\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
The app-controlled pointer that is passed to iface's functions when called\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to the allocated memory on success, or NULL on failure;
call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
