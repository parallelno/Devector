.SH NAME
SDL_AppIterate \- App-implemented iteration entry point for 
.BR SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS
 apps\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_AppIterate(void *appstate);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Apps implement this function when using

.BR SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS
\[char46] If using a standard
"main" function, you should not supply this\[char46]

This function is called repeatedly by SDL after 
.BR SDL_AppInit

returns 0\[char46] The function should operate as a single iteration the program's
primary loop; it should update whatever state it needs and draw a new frame
of video, usually\[char46]

On some platforms, this function will be called at the refresh rate of the
display (which might change during the life of your app!)\[char46] There are no
promises made about what frequency this function might run at\[char46] You should
use SDL's timer functions if you need to see how much time has passed since
the last iteration\[char46]

There is no need to process the SDL event queue during this function; SDL
will send events as they arrive in 
.BR SDL_AppEvent
, and in
most cases the event queue will be empty when this function runs anyhow\[char46]

This function should not go into an infinite mainloop; it should do one
iteration of whatever the program does and return\[char46]

The
.BR appstate
parameter is an optional pointer provided by the app during

.BR SDL_AppInit
()\[char46] If the app never provided a pointer, this
will be NULL\[char46]

If this function returns 0, the app will continue normal operation,
receiving repeated calls to 
.BR SDL_AppIterate
 and

.BR SDL_AppEvent
 for the life of the program\[char46] If this function
returns < 0, SDL will call 
.BR SDL_AppQuit
 and terminate the
process with an exit code that reports an error to the platform\[char46] If it
returns > 0, the SDL calls 
.BR SDL_AppQuit
 and terminates with
an exit code that reports success to the platform\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I appstate
an optional pointer, provided by the app in 
.BR SDL_AppInit
\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns -1 to terminate with an error, 1 to terminate with success, 0 to
continue\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
This function is not thread safe\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
