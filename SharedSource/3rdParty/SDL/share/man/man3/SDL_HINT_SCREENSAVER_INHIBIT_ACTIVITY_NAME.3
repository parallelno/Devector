.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_SCREENSAVER_INHIBIT_ACTIVITY_NAME \- Specify an "activity name" for screensaver inhibition\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some platforms, notably Linux desktops, list the applications which are
inhibiting the screensaver or other power-saving features\[char46]

This hint lets you specify the "activity name" sent to the OS when

.BR SDL_DisableScreenSaver
() is used (or the
screensaver is automatically disabled)\[char46] The contents of this hint are used
when the screensaver is disabled\[char46] You should use a string that describes
what your program is doing (and, therefore, why the screensaver is
disabled)\[char46] For example, "Playing a game" or "Watching a video"\[char46]

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: "Playing a game" or something similar\[char46]

This hint should be set before calling

.BR SDL_DisableScreenSaver
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
