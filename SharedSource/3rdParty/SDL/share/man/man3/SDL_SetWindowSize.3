.TH SDL_SetWindowSize 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetWindowSize \- Request that the size of a window's client area be set\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetWindowSize(SDL_Window *window, int w, int h);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
NULL can safely be passed as the
.BR w
or
.BR h
parameter if the width or
height value is not desired\[char46]

If, at the time of this request, the window in a fixed-size state, such as
maximized or fullscreen, the request will be deferred until the window
exits this state and becomes resizable again\[char46]

To change the fullscreen mode of a window, use

.BR SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode
()

On some windowing systems, this request is asynchronous and the new window
size may not have have been applied immediately upon the return of this
function\[char46] If an immediate change is required, call

.BR SDL_SyncWindow
() to block until the changes have taken
effect\[char46]

When the window size changes, an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_RESIZED
 event will be emitted
with the new window dimensions\[char46] Note that the new dimensions may not match
the exact size requested, as some windowing systems can restrict the window
size in certain scenarios (e\[char46]g\[char46] constraining the size of the content area
to remain within the usable desktop bounds)\[char46] Additionally, as this is just
a request, it can be denied by the windowing system\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to change
.TP
.I w
the width of the window, must be > 0
.TP
.I h
the height of the window, must be > 0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
