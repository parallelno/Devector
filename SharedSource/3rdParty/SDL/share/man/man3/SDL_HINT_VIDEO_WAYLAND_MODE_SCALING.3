.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_MODE_SCALING \- A variable controlling how modes with a non-native aspect ratio are displayed under Wayland\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.BI "#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_MODE_SCALING "SDL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_MODE_SCALING"

.SH DESCRIPTION
When this hint is set, the requested scaling will be used when displaying
fullscreen video modes that don't match the display's native aspect ratio\[char46]
This is contingent on compositor viewport support\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "aspect" - Video modes will be displayed scaled, in their proper aspect
  ratio, with black bars\[char46]

\(bu "stretch" - Video modes will be scaled to fill the entire display\[char46]
  (default)

\(bu "none" - Video modes will be displayed as 1:1 with no scaling\[char46]

This hint should be set before creating a window\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
