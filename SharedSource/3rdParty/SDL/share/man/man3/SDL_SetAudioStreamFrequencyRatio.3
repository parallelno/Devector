.TH SDL_SetAudioStreamFrequencyRatio 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetAudioStreamFrequencyRatio \- Change the frequency ratio of an audio stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetAudioStreamFrequencyRatio(SDL_AudioStream *stream, float ratio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The frequency ratio is used to adjust the rate at which input data is
consumed\[char46] Changing this effectively modifies the speed and pitch of the
audio\[char46] A value greater than 1\[char46]0 will play the audio faster, and at a higher
pitch\[char46] A value less than 1\[char46]0 will play the audio slower, and at a lower
pitch\[char46]

This is applied during 
.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
,
and can be continuously changed to create various effects\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
The stream the frequency ratio is being changed
.TP
.I ratio
The frequency ratio\[char46] 1\[char46]0 is normal speed\[char46] Must be between 0\[char46]01 and 100\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, as it holds a
stream-specific mutex while running\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
