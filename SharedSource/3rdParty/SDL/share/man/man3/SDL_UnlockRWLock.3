.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BI "void SDL_UnlockRWLock(SDL_RWLock *rwlock) SDL_RELEASE_GENERIC(rwlock);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use this function to unlock the rwlock, whether it was locked for read-only
or write operations\[char46]

It is legal for the owning thread to lock an already-locked read-only lock\[char46]
It must unlock it the same number of times before it is actually made
available for other threads in the system (this is known as a "recursive
rwlock")\[char46]

It is illegal to unlock a rwlock that has not been locked by the current
thread, and doing so results in undefined behavior\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rwlock
the rwlock to unlock\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
