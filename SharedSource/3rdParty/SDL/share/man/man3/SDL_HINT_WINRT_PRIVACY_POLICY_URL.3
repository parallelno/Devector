.SH DESCRIPTION
All network-enabled WinRT apps must make a privacy policy available to its
users\[char46] On Windows 8, 8\[char46]1, and RT, Microsoft mandates that this policy be be
available in the Windows Settings charm, as accessed from within the app\[char46]
SDL provides code to add a URL-based link there, which can point to the
app's privacy policy\[char46]

To setup a URL to an app's privacy policy, set

.BR SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL

before calling any 
.BR SDL_Init
() functions\[char46] The contents of the
hint should be a valid URL\[char46] For example, "http://www\[char46]example\[char46]com"\[char46]

The default value is "", which will prevent SDL from adding a privacy
policy link to the Settings charm\[char46] This hint should only be set during app
init\[char46]

The label text of an app's "Privacy Policy" link may be customized via
another hint,

.BR SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL
\[char46]

Please note that on Windows Phone, Microsoft does not provide standard UI
for displaying a privacy policy link, and as such,

.BR SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL
 will
not get used on that platform\[char46] Network-enabled phone apps should display
their privacy policy through some other, in-app means\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
