.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SYSTEM_SCALE \- A variable controlling whether the system mouse acceleration curve is used for relative mouse motion\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SYSTEM_SCALE    "SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SYSTEM_SCALE"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Relative mouse motion will be unscaled\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Relative mouse motion will be scaled using the system mouse
  acceleration curve\[char46]

If

.BR SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SPEED_SCALE

is set, that will override the system speed scale\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
