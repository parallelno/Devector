Thumbstick axis values range from

.BR SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MIN

dead zone, which varies between gamepads\[char46]

Trigger axis values range from 0 (released) to

.BR SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX
 (fully pressed) when
reported by 
.BR SDL_GetGamepadAxis
()\[char46] Note that this is
not the same range that will be reported by the lower-level

.BR SDL_GetJoystickAxis
()\[char46]
