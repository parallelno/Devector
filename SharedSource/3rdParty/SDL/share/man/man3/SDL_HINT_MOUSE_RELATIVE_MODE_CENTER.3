.SH DESCRIPTION
Constraining to the center of the window works better for FPS games and
when the application is running over RDP\[char46] Constraining to the whole window
works better for 2D games and increases the chance that the mouse will be
in the correct position when using high DPI mice\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Relative mouse mode constrains the mouse to the window\[char46]

\(bu "1": Relative mouse mode constrains the mouse to the center of the
  window\[char46] (default)

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
