.SH NAME
SDL_LockSurface \- Set up a surface for directly accessing the pixels\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_surface\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_LockSurface(SDL_Surface *surface);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Between calls to 
.BR SDL_LockSurface
() /

.BR SDL_UnlockSurface
(), you can write to and read from
.BR surface->pixels
, using the pixel format stored in
.BR surface->format
\[char46] Once
you are done accessing the surface, you should use

.BR SDL_UnlockSurface
() to release it\[char46]

Not all surfaces require locking\[char46] If
.BR SDL_MUSTLOCK(surface)
evaluates to
0, then you can read and write to the surface at any time, and the pixel
format of the surface will not change\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I surface
the 
.BR SDL_Surface
 structure to be locked
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
