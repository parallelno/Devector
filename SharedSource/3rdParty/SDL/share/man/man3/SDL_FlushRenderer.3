.SH NAME
SDL_FlushRenderer \- Force the rendering context to flush any pending commands and state\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_render\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_FlushRenderer(SDL_Renderer *renderer);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You do not need to (and in fact, shouldn't) call this function unless you
are planning to call into OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/whatever directly, in
addition to using an 
.BR SDL_Renderer
\[char46]

This is for a very-specific case: if you are using SDL's render API, and
you plan to make OpenGL/D3D/whatever calls in addition to SDL render API
calls\[char46] If this applies, you should call this function between calls to
SDL's render API and the low-level API you're using in cooperation\[char46]

In all other cases, you can ignore this function\[char46]

This call makes SDL flush any pending rendering work it was queueing up to
do later in a single batch, and marks any internal cached state as invalid,
so it'll prepare all its state again later, from scratch\[char46]

This means you do not need to save state in your rendering code to protect
the SDL renderer\[char46] However, there lots of arbitrary pieces of Direct3D and
OpenGL state that can confuse things; you should use your best judgement
and be prepared to make changes if specific state needs to be protected\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

.SH AVAILABILITY
