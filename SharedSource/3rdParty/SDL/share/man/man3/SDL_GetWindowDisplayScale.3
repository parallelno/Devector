.SH NAME
SDL_GetWindowDisplayScale \- Get the content display scale relative to a window's pixel size\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "float SDL_GetWindowDisplayScale(SDL_Window *window);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a combination of the window pixel density and the display content
scale, and is the expected scale for displaying content in this window\[char46] For
example, if a 3840x2160 window had a display scale of 2\[char46]0, the user expects
the content to take twice as many pixels and be the same physical size as
if it were being displayed in a 1920x1080 window with a display scale of
1\[char46]0\[char46]

Conceptually this value corresponds to the scale display setting, and is
updated when that setting is changed, or the window moves to a display with
a different scale setting\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to query
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the display scale, or 0\[char46]0f on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
