.TH SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode \- Set the display mode to use when a window is visible and fullscreen\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode(SDL_Window *window, const SDL_DisplayMode *mode);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This only affects the display mode used when the window is fullscreen\[char46] To
change the window size when the window is not fullscreen, use

.BR SDL_SetWindowSize
()\[char46]

If the window is currently in the fullscreen state, this request is
asynchronous on some windowing systems and the new mode dimensions may not
be applied immediately upon the return of this function\[char46] If an immediate
change is required, call 
.BR SDL_SyncWindow
() to block until
the changes have taken effect\[char46]

When the new mode takes effect, an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_RESIZED
 and/or an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED

event will be emitted with the new mode dimensions\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to affect
.TP
.I mode
a pointer to the display mode to use, which can be NULL for borderless fullscreen desktop mode, or one of the fullscreen modes returned by 
.BR SDL_GetFullscreenDisplayModes
() to set an exclusive fullscreen mode\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
