 events are sent,
  and it is the application's responsibility to render the text from these
  events and differentiate it somehow from committed text\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": If supported by the IME then
  
.BR SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING
 events are not sent, and
  text that is being composed will be rendered in its own UI\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
