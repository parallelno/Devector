.BI "SDL_hid_device_info * SDL_hid_enumerate(unsigned short vendor_id, unsigned short product_id);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a linked list of all the HID devices attached to the
system which match vendor_id and product_id\[char46] If
.BR vendor_id
is set to 0
then any vendor matches\[char46] If
.BR product_id
is set to 0 then any product
matches\[char46] If
.BR vendor_id
and
.BR product_id
are both set to 0, then all HID
devices will be returned\[char46]

By default SDL will only enumerate controllers, to reduce risk of hanging
or crashing on bad drivers, but

.BR SDL_HINT_HIDAPI_ENUMERATE_ONLY_CONTROLLERS

can be set to "0" to enumerate all HID devices\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

.I vendor_id
The Vendor ID (VID) of the types of device to open, or 0 to match any vendor\[char46]
.TP
.I product_id
The Product ID (PID) of the types of device to open, or 0 to match any product\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to a linked list of type

.BR SDL_hid_device_info
, containing information about
the HID devices attached to the system, or NULL in the case of failure\[char46]
Free this linked list by calling

.BR SDL_hid_free_enumeration
()\[char46]
