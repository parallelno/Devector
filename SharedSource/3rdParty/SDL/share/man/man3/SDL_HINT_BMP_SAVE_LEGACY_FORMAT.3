.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH DESCRIPTION
The bitmap header version 4 is required for proper alpha channel support
and SDL will use it when required\[char46] Should this not be desired, this hint
can force the use of the 40 byte header version which is supported
everywhere\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Surfaces with a colorkey or an alpha channel are saved to a 32-bit
  BMP file with an alpha mask\[char46] SDL will use the bitmap header version 4 and
  set the alpha mask accordingly\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Surfaces with a colorkey or an alpha channel are saved to a 32-bit
  BMP file without an alpha mask\[char46] The alpha channel data will be in the
  file, but applications are going to ignore it\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
