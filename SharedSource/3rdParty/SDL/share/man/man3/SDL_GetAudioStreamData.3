.TH SDL_GetAudioStreamData 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetAudioStreamData \- Get converted/resampled data from the stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetAudioStreamData(SDL_AudioStream *stream, void *buf, int len);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The input/output data format/channels/samplerate is specified when creating
the stream, and can be changed after creation by calling

.BR SDL_SetAudioStreamFormat
\[char46]

Note that any conversion and resampling necessary is done during this call,
and 
.BR SDL_PutAudioStreamData
 simply queues
unconverted data for later\[char46] This is different than SDL2, where that work
was done while inputting new data to the stream and requesting the output
just copied the converted data\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
The stream the audio is being requested from
.TP
.I buf
A buffer to fill with audio data
.TP
.I len
The maximum number of bytes to fill
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes read from the stream, or -1 on error

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, but if the stream has a
callback set, the caller might need to manage extra locking\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
