.SH NAME
SDL_OpenURL \- Open a URL/URI in the browser or other appropriate external application\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_misc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_OpenURL(const char *url);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Open a URL in a separate, system-provided application\[char46] How this works will
vary wildly depending on the platform\[char46] This will likely launch what makes
sense to handle a specific URL's protocol (a web browser for
.BR http://
,
etc), but it might also be able to launch file managers for directories and
other things\[char46]

What happens when you open a URL varies wildly as well: your game window
may lose focus (and may or may not lose focus if your game was fullscreen
or grabbing input at the time)\[char46] On mobile devices, your app will likely
move to the background or your process might be paused\[char46] Any given platform
may or may not handle a given URL\[char46]

If this is unimplemented (or simply unavailable) for a platform, this will
fail with an error\[char46] A successful result does not mean the URL loaded, just
that we launched _something_ to handle it (or at least believe we did)\[char46]

All this to say: this function can be useful, but you should definitely
test it on every platform you target\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I url
A valid URL/URI to open\[char46] Use
.BR file:///full/path/to/file
for local files, if supported\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
