.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Note that this might not be the native format of the hardware, as SDL might
be converting to this format behind the scenes\[char46]

If the system is waiting for the user to approve access to the camera, as
some platforms require, this will return -1, but this isn't necessarily a
fatal error; you should either wait for an

.BR SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_APPROVED
 (or

.BR SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_DENIED
) event, or
poll 
.BR SDL_IsCameraApproved
() occasionally until it
returns non-zero\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I camera
opened camera device
.TP
.I spec
The 
.BR SDL_CameraSpec

() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY

.SH AVAILABILITY
