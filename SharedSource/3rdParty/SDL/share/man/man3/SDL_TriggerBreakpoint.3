.SH NAME
SDL_TriggerBreakpoint \- Attempt to tell an attached debugger to pause\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_assert\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_TriggerBreakpoint() TriggerABreakpointInAPlatformSpecificManner
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This allows an app to programmatically halt ("break") the debugger as if it
had hit a breakpoint, allowing the developer to examine program state, etc\[char46]

This is a macro--not a function--so that the debugger breaks on the source
code line that used 
.BR SDL_TriggerBreakpoint
 and not
in some random guts of SDL\[char46] 
.BR SDL_assert
 uses this macro for
the same reason\[char46]

If the program is not running under a debugger,

.BR SDL_TriggerBreakpoint
 will likely terminate the
app, possibly without warning\[char46] If the current platform isn't supported (SDL
doesn't know how to trigger a breakpoint), this macro does nothing\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
