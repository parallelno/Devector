.SH NAME
SDL_AddEventWatch \- Add a callback to be triggered when an event is added to the event queue\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_events\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_AddEventWatch(SDL_EventFilter filter, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR filter
will be called when an event happens, and its return value is
ignored\[char46]
.B WARNING
: Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function,
as it may run in a different thread!

If the quit event is generated by a signal (e\[char46]g\[char46] SIGINT), it will bypass
the internal queue and be delivered to the watch callback immediately, and
arrive at the next event poll\[char46]

Note: the callback is called for events posted by the user through

.BR SDL_PushEvent
(), but not for disabled events, nor for
events by a filter callback set with

.BR SDL_SetEventFilter
(), nor for events posted by the
user through 
.BR SDL_PeepEvents
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
