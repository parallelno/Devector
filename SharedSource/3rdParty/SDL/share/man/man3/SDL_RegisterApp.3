.TH SDL_RegisterApp 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RegisterApp \- Register a win32 window class for SDL's use\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_RegisterApp(const char *name, Uint32 style, void *hInst);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can be called to set the application window class at startup\[char46] It is
safe to call this multiple times, as long as every call is eventually
paired with a call to 
.BR SDL_UnregisterApp
, but a second
registration attempt while a previous registration is still active will be
ignored, other than to increment a counter\[char46]

Most applications do not need to, and should not, call this directly; SDL
will call it when initializing the video subsystem\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I name
the window class name, in UTF-8 encoding\[char46] If NULL, SDL currently uses "
.BR SDL_app
" but this isn't guaranteed\[char46]
.TP
.I style
the value to use in WNDCLASSEX::style\[char46] If
.BR name
is NULL, SDL currently uses
.BR (CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT | CS_OWNDC)
regardless of what is specified here\[char46]
.TP
.I hInst
the HINSTANCE to use in WNDCLASSEX::hInstance\[char46] If zero, SDL will use
.BR GetModuleHandle(NULL)
instead\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
