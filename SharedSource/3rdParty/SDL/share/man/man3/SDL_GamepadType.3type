.SH DESCRIPTION
This type does not necessarily map to first-party controllers from
Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo; in many cases, third-party controllers can report
as these, either because they were designed for a specific console, or they
simply most closely match that console's controllers (does it have A/B/X/Y
buttons or X/O/Square/Triangle? Does it have a touchpad? etc)\[char46]
