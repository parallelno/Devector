.SH DESCRIPTION
Some audio backends (such as PulseAudio) allow you to describe your audio
stream\[char46] Among other things, this description might show up in a system
control panel that lets the user adjust the volume on specific audio
streams instead of using one giant master volume slider\[char46]

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS\[char46] The contents of
this hint are used while opening an audio device\[char46] You should use a string
that describes your what your program is playing ("audio stream" is
probably sufficient in many cases, but this could be useful for something
like "team chat" if you have a headset playing VoIP audio separately)\[char46]

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: "audio stream" or something similar\[char46]

Note that while this talks about audio streams, this is an OS-level
concept, so it applies to a physical audio device in this case, and not an

.BR SDL_AudioStream
, nor an SDL logical audio device\[char46]

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
