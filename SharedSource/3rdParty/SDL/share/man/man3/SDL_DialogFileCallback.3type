.SH DESCRIPTION
The specific usage is described in each function\[char46]

If filelist is\[char46]\[char46]\[char46] -
.BR NULL
, an error occured\[char46] Details can be obtained with

.BR SDL_GetError
()\[char46] - A pointer to
.BR NULL
, the user either
didn't choose any file or canceled the dialog\[char46] - A pointer to non-
.BR NULL
,
the user chose one or more files\[char46] The argument is a null-terminated list of
pointers to C strings, each containing a path\[char46]

The filelist argument does not need to be freed; it will automatically be
freed when the callback returns\[char46]

The filter argument is the index of the filter that was selected, or one
more than the size of the list (therefore the index of the terminating NULL
entry) if no filter was selected, or -1 if the platform or method doesn't
support fetching the selected filter\[char46]
