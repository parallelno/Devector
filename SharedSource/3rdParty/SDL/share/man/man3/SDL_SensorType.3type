.SH DESCRIPTION
Additional sensors may be available, using platform dependent semantics\[char46]

Here are the additional Android sensors:

https://developer\[char46]android\[char46]com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent\[char46]html#values

Accelerometer sensor notes:

The accelerometer returns the current acceleration in SI meters per second
squared\[char46] This measurement includes the force of gravity, so a device at
rest will have an value of 
.BR SDL_STANDARD_GRAVITY

away from the center of the earth, which is a positive Y value\[char46]

-
.BR values[0]
: Acceleration on the x axis
-
.BR values[1]
: Acceleration on the y axis
-
.BR values[2]
: Acceleration on the z axis

For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:


\(bu -X \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +X : left \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] right

\(bu -Y \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +Y : bottom \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] top

\(bu -Z \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +Z : farther \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] closer

The accelerometer axis data is not changed when the device is rotated\[char46]

Gyroscope sensor notes:

The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second\[char46]
The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction\[char46] That is, an
observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would see
positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
counter-clockwise\[char46]

-
.BR values[0]
: Angular speed around the x axis (pitch)
-
.BR values[1]
: Angular speed around the y axis (yaw)
-
.BR values[2]
: Angular speed around the z axis (roll)

For phones and tablets held in natural orientation and game controllers
held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:


\(bu -X \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +X : left \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] right

\(bu -Y \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +Y : bottom \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] top

\(bu -Z \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] +Z : farther \[char46]\[char46]\[char46] closer

The gyroscope axis data is not changed when the device is rotated\[char46]
