.SH NAME
SDL_IOFromConstMem \- Use this function to prepare a read-only memory buffer for use with 
.BR SDL_IOStream
\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_iostream\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_IOStream* SDL_IOFromConstMem(const void *mem, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function sets up an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 struct based on a
memory area of a certain size\[char46] It assumes the memory area is not writable\[char46]

Attempting to write to this 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 stream will report
an error without writing to the memory buffer\[char46]

This memory buffer is not copied by the 
.BR SDL_IOStream
; the
pointer you provide must remain valid until you close the stream\[char46] Closing
the stream will not free the original buffer\[char46]

If you need to write to a memory buffer, you should use

.BR SDL_IOFromMem
() with a writable buffer of memory instead\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mem
a pointer to a read-only buffer to feed an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 stream
.TP
.I size
the buffer size, in bytes
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to a new 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 structure, or NULL
if it fails; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
