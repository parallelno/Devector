.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL can try to accelerate the SDL screen surface by using streaming
textures with a 3D rendering engine\[char46] This variable controls whether and how
this is done\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Disable 3D acceleration

\(bu "1": Enable 3D acceleration, using the default renderer\[char46] (default)

\(bu "X": Enable 3D acceleration, using X where X is one of the valid
  rendering drivers\[char46] (e\[char46]g\[char46] "direct3d", "opengl", etc\[char46])

This hint should be set before calling
