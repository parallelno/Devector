.TH SDL_GetBasePath 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetBasePath \- Get the directory where the application was run from\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_filesystem\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "char* SDL_GetBasePath(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is not necessarily a fast call, so you should call this once near
startup and save the string if you need it\[char46]
.B macOS and iOS Specific Functionality
: If the application is in a "\[char46]app"
bundle, this function returns the Resource directory (e\[char46]g\[char46]
MyApp\[char46]app/Contents/Resources/)\[char46] This behaviour can be overridden by adding
a property to the Info\[char46]plist file\[char46] Adding a string key with the name

.BR SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE
 with a
supported value will change the behaviour\[char46]

Supported values for the

.BR SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE
 property
(Given an application in /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp\[char46]app):

-
.BR resource
: bundle resource directory (the default)\[char46] For example:
.BR /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp\[char46]app/Contents/Resources
-
.BR bundle
: the Bundle directory\[char46] For example:
.BR /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp\[char46]app/
-
.BR parent
: the containing directory of the bundle\[char46] For example:
.BR /Applications/SDLApp/
.B Nintendo 3DS Specific Functionality
: This function returns "romfs"
directory of the application as it is uncommon to store resources outside
the executable\[char46] As such it is not a writable directory\[char46]

The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\\' on
Windows, '/' on most other platforms)\[char46]

The pointer returned is owned by the caller\[char46] Please call

.BR SDL_free
() on the pointer when done with it\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding to the application data
directory\[char46] NULL will be returned on error or when the platform doesn't
implement this functionality, call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more
information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
