.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_FORCE_RAISEWINDOW \- A variable controlling whether raising the window should be done more forcefully\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_FORCE_RAISEWINDOW    "SDL_FORCE_RAISEWINDOW"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Honor the OS policy for raising windows\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Force the window to be raised, overriding any OS policy\[char46]

At present, this is only an issue under MS Windows, which makes it nearly
impossible to programmatically move a window to the foreground, for
"security" reasons\[char46] See http://stackoverflow\[char46]com/a/34414846 for a
discussion\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
