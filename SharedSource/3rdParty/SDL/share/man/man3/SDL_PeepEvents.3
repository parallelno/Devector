.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR action
may be any of the following:


\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_ADDEVENT
: up to
.BR numevents
events will be added to
  the back of the event queue\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_PEEKEVENT
:
.BR numevents
events at the front of the
  event queue, within the specified minimum and maximum type, will be
  returned to the caller and will _not_ be removed from the queue\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_GETEVENT
: up to
.BR numevents
events at the front of
  the event queue, within the specified minimum and maximum type, will be
  returned to the caller and will be removed from the queue\[char46]

You may have to call 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() before calling this

call 
.BR SDL_PeepEvents
()\[char46]

This function is thread-safe\[char46]
