.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_FILE_DIALOG_DRIVER \- A variable that specifies a dialog backend to use\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.BI "#define SDL_HINT_FILE_DIALOG_DRIVER "SDL_FILE_DIALOG_DRIVER"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, SDL will try all available dialog backends in a reasonable
order until it finds one that can work, but this hint allows the app or
user to force a specific target\[char46]

If the specified target does not exist or is not available, the
dialog-related function calls will fail\[char46]

This hint currently only applies to platforms using the generic "Unix"
dialog implementation, but may be extended to more platforms in the future\[char46]
Note that some Unix and Unix-like platforms have their own implementation,
such as macOS and Haiku\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu NULL: Select automatically (default, all platforms)

\(bu "portal": Use XDG Portals through DBus (Unix only)

\(bu "zenity": Use the Zenity program (Unix only)

More options may be added in the future\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
