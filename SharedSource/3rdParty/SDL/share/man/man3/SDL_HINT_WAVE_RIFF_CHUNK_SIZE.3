.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE \- A variable controlling how the size of the RIFF chunk affects the loading of a WAVE file\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE   "SDL_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The size of the RIFF chunk (which includes all the sub-chunks of the WAVE
file) is not always reliable\[char46] In case the size is wrong, it's possible to
just ignore it and step through the chunks until a fixed limit is reached\[char46]

Note that files that have trailing data unrelated to the WAVE file or
corrupt files may slow down the loading process without a reliable
boundary\[char46] By default, SDL stops after 10000 chunks to prevent wasting time\[char46]
Use the environment variable 
.BR SDL_WAVE_CHUNK_LIMIT

to adjust this value\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "force" - Always use the RIFF chunk size as a boundary for the chunk
  search\[char46]

\(bu "ignorezero" - Like "force", but a zero size searches up to 4 GiB\[char46]
  (default)

\(bu "ignore" - Ignore the RIFF chunk size and always search up to 4 GiB\[char46]

\(bu "maximum" - Search for chunks until the end of file\[char46] (not recommended)

This hint should be set before calling 
.BR SDL_LoadWAV
() or

.BR SDL_LoadWAV_IO
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
