.TH SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat \- Get the current audio format of a specific audio device\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat(SDL_AudioDeviceID devid, SDL_AudioSpec *spec, int *sample_frames);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For an opened device, this will report the format the device is currently
using\[char46] If the device isn't yet opened, this will report the device's
preferred format (or a reasonable default if this can't be determined)\[char46]

You may also specify

.BR SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT
 or

.BR SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_CAPTURE
 here,
which is useful for getting a reasonable recommendation before opening the
system-recommended default device\[char46]

You can also use this to request the current device buffer size\[char46] This is
specified in sample frames and represents the amount of data SDL will feed
to the physical hardware in each chunk\[char46] This can be converted to
milliseconds of audio with the following equation:
.BR ms = (int) ((((Sint64) frames) * 1000) / spec\[char46]freq);
Buffer size is only important if you need low-level control over the audio
playback timing\[char46] Most apps do not need this\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I devid
the instance ID of the device to query\[char46]
.TP
.I spec
On return, will be filled with device details\[char46]
.TP
.I sample_frames
Pointer to store device buffer size, in sample frames\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
