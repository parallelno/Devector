.BI "SDL_bool SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(const char *extension);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function operates on the current GL context; you must have created a
context and it must be current before calling this function\[char46] Do not assume
that all contexts you create will have the same set of extensions
available, or that recreating an existing context will offer the same
extensions again\[char46]

While it's probably not a massive overhead, this function is not an O(1)
operation\[char46] Check the extensions you care about after creating the GL
context and save that information somewhere instead of calling the function
every time you need to know\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I extension
the name of the extension to check
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 
.BR SDL_TRUE
 if the extension is supported,

.BR SDL_FALSE
 otherwise\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
