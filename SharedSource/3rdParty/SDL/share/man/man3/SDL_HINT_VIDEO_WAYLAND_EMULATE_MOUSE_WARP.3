.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP \- Enable or disable hidden mouse pointer warp emulation, needed by some older games\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP "SDL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wayland requires the pointer confinement protocol to warp the mouse, but
that is just a hint that the compositor is free to ignore, and warping the
the pointer to or from regions outside of the focused window is prohibited\[char46]
When this hint is set and the pointer is hidden, SDL will emulate mouse
warps using relative mouse mode\[char46] This is required for some older games
(such as Source engine games), which warp the mouse to the centre of the
screen rather than using relative mouse motion\[char46] Note that relative mouse
mode may have different mouse acceleration behaviour than pointer warps\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Attempts to warp the mouse will be made, if the appropriate protocol
  is available\[char46]

\(bu "1": Some mouse warps will be emulated by forcing relative mouse mode\[char46]

If not set, this is automatically enabled unless an application uses
relative mouse mode directly\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
