.SH NAME
SDL_SetAssertionHandler \- Set an application-defined assertion handler\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_assert\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_SetAssertionHandler(
.BI "                    SDL_AssertionHandler handler,
.BI "                    void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function allows an application to show its own assertion UI and/or
force the response to an assertion failure\[char46] If the application doesn't
provide this, SDL will try to do the right thing, popping up a
system-specific GUI dialog, and probably minimizing any fullscreen windows\[char46]

This callback may fire from any thread, but it runs wrapped in a mutex, so
it will only fire from one thread at a time\[char46]

This callback is NOT reset to SDL's internal handler upon

.BR SDL_Quit
()!
