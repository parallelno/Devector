.PP
.BI "Uint32 SDL_hid_device_change_count(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Enumerating the HID devices is an expensive operation, so you can call this
to see if there have been any system device changes since the last call to
this function\[char46] A change in the counter returned doesn't necessarily mean
that anything has changed, but you can call

.BR SDL_hid_enumerate
() to get an updated device list\[char46]

Calling this function for the first time may cause a thread or other system
resource to be allocated to track device change notifications\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a change counter that is incremented with each potential device
change, or 0 if device change detection isn't available\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
