.SH NAME
SDL_wcsncmp \- Compare two wide strings up to a number of wchar_t values\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_wcsncmp(const wchar_t *str1, const wchar_t *str2, size_t maxlen);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This only compares wchar_t values; it does not care if the string is
well-formed UTF-16 (or UTF-32, depending on your platform's wchar_t size),
or uses valid Unicode values\[char46]

Note that while this function is intended to be used with UTF-16 (or
UTF-32, depending on your platform's definition of wchar_t), it is
comparing raw wchar_t values and not Unicode codepoints:
.BR maxlen
specifies
a wchar_t limit! If the limit lands in the middle of a multi-wchar UTF-16
sequence, it will only compare a portion of the final character\[char46]
.BR maxlen
specifies a maximum number of wchar_t to compare; if the strings
match to this number of wide chars (or both have matched to a
null-terminator character before this count), they will be considered
equal\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I str1
The first string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.TP
.I str2
The second string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.TP
.I maxlen
The maximum number of wchar_t to compare\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns less than zero if str1 is "less than" str2, greater than zero if
str1 is "greater than" str2, and zero if the strings match exactly\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
