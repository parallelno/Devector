.SH DESCRIPTION
This will unconditionally remove any events from the queue that match
.BR type
\[char46] If you need to remove a range of event types, use

.BR SDL_FlushEvents
() instead\[char46]

It's also normal to just ignore events you don't care about in your event
loop without calling this function\[char46]

This function only affects currently queued events\[char46] If you want to make
sure that all pending OS events are flushed, you can call

.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() on the main thread immediately before
the flush call\[char46]

If you have user events with custom data that needs to be freed, you should
use 
.BR SDL_PeepEvents
() to remove and clean up those events
before calling this function\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I type
the type of event to be cleared; see 
.BR SDL_EventType
