.SH NAME
SDL_SetAudioStreamFormat \- Change the input and output formats of an audio stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetAudioStreamFormat(SDL_AudioStream *stream,
.BI "                             const SDL_AudioSpec *src_spec,
.BI "                             const SDL_AudioSpec *dst_spec);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Future calls to and

.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamAvailable
 and

.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
 will reflect the new
format, and future calls to

.BR SDL_PutAudioStreamData
 must provide data in the
new input formats\[char46]

Data that was previously queued in the stream will still be operated on in
the format that was current when it was added, which is to say you can put
the end of a sound file in one format to a stream, change formats for the
next sound file, and start putting that new data while the previous sound
file is still queued, and everything will still play back correctly\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
The stream the format is being changed
.TP
.I src_spec
The new format of the audio input; if NULL, it is not changed\[char46]
.TP
.I dst_spec
The new format of the audio output; if NULL, it is not changed\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, as it holds a
stream-specific mutex while running\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
