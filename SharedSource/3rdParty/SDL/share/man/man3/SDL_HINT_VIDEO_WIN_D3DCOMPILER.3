.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WIN_D3DCOMPILER \- A variable specifying which shader compiler to preload when using the Chrome ANGLE binaries\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WIN_D3DCOMPILER              "SDL_VIDEO_WIN_D3DCOMPILER"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL has EGL and OpenGL ES2 support on Windows via the ANGLE project\[char46] It can
use two different sets of binaries, those compiled by the user from source
or those provided by the Chrome browser\[char46] In the later case, these binaries
require that SDL loads a DLL providing the shader compiler\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "d3dcompiler_46\[char46]dll" - best for Vista or later\[char46] (default)

\(bu "d3dcompiler_43\[char46]dll" - for XP support\[char46]

\(bu "none" - do not load any library, useful if you compiled ANGLE from
  source and included the compiler in your binaries\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
