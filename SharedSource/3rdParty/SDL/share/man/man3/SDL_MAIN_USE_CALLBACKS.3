.SH NAME
SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS \- Inform SDL to use the main callbacks instead of main\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS 1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL does not define this macro, but will check if it is defined when
including
.BR SDL_main\[char46]h
\[char46] If defined, SDL will expect the app to provide
several functions: 
.BR SDL_AppInit
,

.BR SDL_AppEvent
, 
.BR SDL_AppIterate
, and

.BR SDL_AppQuit
\[char46] The app should not provide a
.BR main
function in
this case, and doing so will likely cause the build to fail\[char46]

Please see [README/main-functions](README/main-functions), (or
docs/README-main-functions\[char46]md in the source tree) for a more detailed
explanation\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is used by the headers since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR SDL_AppInit (3),
.BR SDL_AppEvent (3),
.BR SDL_AppIterate (3),
