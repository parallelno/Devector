.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_PEN_NOT_MOUSE    "SDL_PEN_NOT_MOUSE"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, pens report both 
.BR SDL_MouseMotionEvent

and 
.BR SDL_PenMotionEvent
 updates (analogously for
button presses)\[char46] This hint allows decoupling mouse and pen updates\[char46]

This variable toggles between the following behaviour:


\(bu "0": Pen acts as a mouse with mouse ID
  
.BR SDL_PEN_MOUSEID
\[char46] (default) Use case: client
  application is not pen aware, user wants to use pen instead of mouse to
  interact\[char46]

\(bu "1": Pen reports mouse clicks and movement events but does not update
  SDL-internal mouse state (buttons pressed, current mouse location)\[char46] Use
  case: client application is not pen aware, user frequently alternates
  between pen and "real" mouse\[char46]

\(bu "2": Pen reports no mouse events\[char46] Use case: pen-aware client application
  uses this hint to allow user to toggle between pen+mouse mode ("2") and
  pen-only mode ("1" or "0")\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
