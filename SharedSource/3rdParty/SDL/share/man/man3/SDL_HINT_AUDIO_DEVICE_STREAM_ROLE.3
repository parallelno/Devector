.SH DESCRIPTION
Some audio backends (such as Pipewire) allow you to describe the role of
your audio stream\[char46] Among other things, this description might show up in a
system control panel or software for displaying and manipulating media
playback/capture graphs\[char46]

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS\[char46] The contents of
this hint are used while opening an audio device\[char46] You should use a string
that describes your what your program is playing (Game, Music, Movie,
etc\[char46]\[char46]\[char46])\[char46]

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: "Game" or something similar\[char46]

Note that while this talks about audio streams, this is an OS-level
concept, so it applies to a physical audio device in this case, and not an

.BR SDL_AudioStream
, nor an SDL logical audio device\[char46]

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
