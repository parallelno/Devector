.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_THREAD_PRIORITY_POLICY \- A string specifying additional information to use with 
.BR SDL_SetThreadPriority
\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default 
.BR SDL_SetThreadPriority
 will make
appropriate system changes in order to apply a thread priority\[char46] For example
on systems using pthreads the scheduler policy is changed automatically to
a policy that works well with a given priority\[char46] Code which has specific
requirements can override SDL's default behavior with this hint\[char46]

pthread hint values are "current", "other", "fifo" and "rr"\[char46] Currently no
other platform hint values are defined but may be in the future\[char46]

On Linux, the kernel may send SIGKILL to realtime tasks which exceed the
distro configured execution budget for rtkit\[char46] This budget can be queried
through RLIMIT_RTTIME after calling

.BR SDL_SetThreadPriority
()\[char46]

This hint should be set before calling

.BR SDL_SetThreadPriority
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
