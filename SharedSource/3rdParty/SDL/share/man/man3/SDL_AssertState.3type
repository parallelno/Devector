.BI "{

.SH DESCRIPTION
When an enabled assertion triggers, it may call the assertion handler
(possibly one provided by the app via

.BR SDL_SetAssertionHandler
), which will return one
of these values, possibly after asking the user\[char46]

Then SDL will respond based on this outcome (loop around to retry the
condition, try to break in a debugger, kill the program, or ignore the
problem)\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
