.SH DESCRIPTION
When polling for events, 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
 is used to gather
new events from devices\[char46] If a device keeps producing new events between
calls to 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
, a poll loop will become stuck
until the new events stop\[char46] This is most noticeable when moving a high
frequency mouse\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Disable poll sentinels\[char46]

\(bu "1": Enable poll sentinels\[char46] (default)

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
