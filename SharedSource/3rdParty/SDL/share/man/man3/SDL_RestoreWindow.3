.SH NAME
SDL_RestoreWindow \- Request that the size and position of a minimized or maximized window be restored\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_RestoreWindow(SDL_Window *window);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
On some windowing systems this request is asynchronous and the new window
state may not have have been applied immediately upon the return of this
function\[char46] If an immediate change is required, call

.BR SDL_SyncWindow
() to block until the changes have taken
effect\[char46]

When the window state changes, an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_RESTORED
 event will be
emitted\[char46] Note that, as this is just a request, the windowing system can
deny the state change\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to restore
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
