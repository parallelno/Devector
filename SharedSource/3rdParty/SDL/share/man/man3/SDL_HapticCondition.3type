.SH DESCRIPTION
The struct handles the following effects:


\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING
: Effect based on axes position\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER
: Effect based on axes velocity\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA
: Effect based on axes
  acceleration\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION
: Effect based on axes
  movement\[char46]

Direction is handled by condition internals instead of a direction member\[char46]
The condition effect specific members have three parameters\[char46] The first
refers to the X axis, the second refers to the Y axis and the third refers
to the Z axis\[char46] The right terms refer to the positive side of the axis and
the left terms refer to the negative side of the axis\[char46] Please refer to the

.BR SDL_HapticDirection
 diagram for which side is
positive and which is negative\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
