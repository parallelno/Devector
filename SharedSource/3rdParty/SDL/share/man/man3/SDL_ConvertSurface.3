.SH NAME
SDL_ConvertSurface \- Copy an existing surface to a new surface of the specified format\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_surface\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_Surface* SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface *surface, const SDL_PixelFormat *format);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used to optimize images for faster
.I repeat
blitting\[char46] This
is accomplished by converting the original and storing the result as a new
surface\[char46] The new, optimized surface can then be used as the source for
future blits, making them faster\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I surface
the existing 
.BR SDL_Surface
 structure to convert
.TP
.I format
the 
.BR SDL_PixelFormat
 structure that the new surface is optimized for
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the new 
.BR SDL_Surface
 structure that is created or
NULL if it fails; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
