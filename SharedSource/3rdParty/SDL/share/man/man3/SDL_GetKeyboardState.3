.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BI "const Uint8* SDL_GetKeyboardState(int *numkeys);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pointer returned is a pointer to an internal SDL array\[char46] It will be
valid for the whole lifetime of the application and should not be freed by
the caller\[char46]

A array element with a value of 1 means that the key is pressed and a value
of 0 means that it is not\[char46] Indexes into this array are obtained by using

.BR SDL_Scancode
 values\[char46]

Use 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() to update the state array\[char46]

This function gives you the current state after all events have been
processed, so if a key or button has been pressed and released before you
process events, then the pressed state will never show up in the

.BR SDL_GetKeyboardState
() calls\[char46]

Note: This function doesn't take into account whether shift has been
pressed or not\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I numkeys
if non-NULL, receives the length of the returned array
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to an array of key states\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
