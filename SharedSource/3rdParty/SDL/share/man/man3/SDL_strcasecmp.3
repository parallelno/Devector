.SH NAME
SDL_strcasecmp \- Compare two null-terminated UTF-8 strings, case-insensitively\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_strcasecmp(const char *str1, const char *str2);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will work with Unicode strings, using a technique called
"case-folding" to handle the vast majority of case-sensitive human
languages regardless of system locale\[char46] It can deal with expanding values: a
German Eszett character can compare against two ASCII 's' chars and be
considered a match, for example\[char46] A notable exception: it does not handle
the Turkish 'i' character; human language is complicated!

Since this handles Unicode, it expects the string to be well-formed UTF-8
and not a null-terminated string of arbitrary bytes\[char46] Bytes that are not
valid UTF-8 are treated as Unicode character U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER), which is to say two strings of random bits may turn out to
match if they convert to the same amount of replacement characters\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I str1
The first string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.TP
.I str2
The second string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns less than zero if str1 is "less than" str2, greater than zero if
str1 is "greater than" str2, and zero if the strings match exactly\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
