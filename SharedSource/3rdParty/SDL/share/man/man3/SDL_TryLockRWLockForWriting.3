.SH NAME
SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting \- Try to lock a read/write lock _for writing_ without blocking\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting(SDL_RWLock *rwlock) SDL_TRY_ACQUIRE(0, rwlock);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works just like

.BR SDL_LockRWLockForWriting
(), but if the rwlock
is not available, this function returns

.BR
.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEDOUT
immediately\[char46]

This technique is useful if you need exclusive access to a resource but
don't want to wait for it, and will return to it to try again later\[char46]

It is illegal for the owning thread to lock an already-locked rwlock for
writing (read-only may be locked recursively, writing can not)\[char46] Doing so
results in undefined behavior\[char46]

It is illegal to request a write lock from a thread that already holds a
read-only lock\[char46] Doing so results in undefined behavior\[char46] Unlock the
read-only lock before requesting a write lock\[char46]

This function does not fail; if rwlock is NULL, it will return 0
immediately having locked nothing\[char46] If rwlock is valid, this function will
always either lock the rwlock and return 0, or return

.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEOUT
 and lock nothing\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rwlock
the rwlock to try to lock
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 or 
.BR
.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEDOUT

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
