.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, SDL will try all available storage backends in a reasonable
order until it finds one that can work, but this hint allows the app or
user to force a specific target, such as "pc" if, say, you are on Steam but
want to avoid SteamRemoteStorage for user data\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
