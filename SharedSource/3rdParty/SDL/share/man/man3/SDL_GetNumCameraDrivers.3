.SH NAME
SDL_GetNumCameraDrivers \- Use this function to get the number of built-in camera drivers\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_camera\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetNumCameraDrivers(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a hardcoded number\[char46] This never returns a negative
value; if there are no drivers compiled into this build of SDL, this
function returns zero\[char46] The presence of a driver in this list does not mean
it will function, it just means SDL is capable of interacting with that
interface\[char46] For example, a build of SDL might have v4l2 support, but if
there's no kernel support available, SDL's v4l2 driver would fail if used\[char46]

By default, SDL tries all drivers, in its preferred order, until one is
found to be usable\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of built-in camera drivers\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
