.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR SDL_AudioStream
 is an audio conversion interface\[char46]


\(bu It can handle resampling data in chunks without generating artifacts,
  when it doesn't have the complete buffer available\[char46]

\(bu It can handle incoming data in any variable size\[char46]

\(bu It can handle input/output format changes on the fly\[char46]

\(bu You push data as you have it, and pull it when you need it

\(bu It can also function as a basic audio data queue even if you just have
  sound that needs to pass from one place to another\[char46]

\(bu You can hook callbacks up to them when more data is added or requested,
  to manage data on-the-fly\[char46]

Audio streams are the core of the SDL3 audio interface\[char46] You create one or
more of them, bind them to an opened audio device, and feed data to them
(or for recording, consume data from them)\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
