.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, most lowlevel 2D APIs will use a triple buffer scheme that
wastes no CPU time on waiting for vsync after issuing a flip, but
introduces a frame of latency\[char46] On the other hand, using a double buffer
scheme instead is recommended for cases where low latency is an important
factor because we save a whole frame of latency\[char46]

We do so by waiting for vsync immediately after issuing a flip, usually
just after eglSwapBuffers call in the backend's *_SwapWindow function\[char46]

This hint is currently supported on the following drivers:


\(bu Raspberry Pi (raspberrypi)

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
