.SH NAME
SDL_MemoryBarrierReleaseFunction \- Insert a memory release barrier\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_atomic\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Memory barriers are designed to prevent reads and writes from being
reordered by the compiler and being seen out of order on multi-core CPUs\[char46]

A typical pattern would be for thread A to write some data and a flag, and
for thread B to read the flag and get the data\[char46] In this case you would
insert a release barrier between writing the data and the flag,
guaranteeing that the data write completes no later than the flag is
written, and you would insert an acquire barrier between reading the flag
and reading the data, to ensure that all the reads associated with the flag
have completed\[char46]

In this pattern you should always see a release barrier paired with an
acquire barrier and you should gate the data reads/writes with a single
flag variable\[char46]

For more information on these semantics, take a look at the blog post:

.SH THREAD SAFETY
Obviously this macro is safe to use from any thread at any time, but if you
find yourself needing this, you are probably dealing with some very
sensitive code; be careful!

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
