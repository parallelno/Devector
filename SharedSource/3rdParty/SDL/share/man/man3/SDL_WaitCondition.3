.SH NAME
SDL_WaitCondition \- Wait until a condition variable is signaled\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_WaitCondition(SDL_Condition *cond, SDL_Mutex *mutex);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function unlocks the specified
.BR mutex
and waits for another thread to
call 
.BR SDL_SignalCondition
() or

.BR SDL_BroadcastCondition
() on the condition
variable
.BR cond
\[char46] Once the condition variable is signaled, the mutex is
re-locked and the function returns\[char46]

The mutex must be locked before calling this function\[char46] Locking the mutex
recursively (more than once) is not supported and leads to undefined
behavior\[char46]

This function is the equivalent of calling

.BR SDL_WaitConditionTimeout
() with a time length
of -1\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I cond
the condition variable to wait on
.TP
.I mutex
the mutex used to coordinate thread access
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 when it is signaled or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
