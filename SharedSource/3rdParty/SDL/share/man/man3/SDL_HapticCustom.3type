.SH DESCRIPTION
This struct is exclusively for the 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_CUSTOM

effect\[char46]

A custom force feedback effect is much like a periodic effect, where the
application can define its exact shape\[char46] You will have to allocate the data
yourself\[char46] Data should consist of channels * samples Uint16 samples\[char46]

If channels is one, the effect is rotated using the defined direction\[char46]
Otherwise it uses the samples in data for the different axes\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
