.SH NAME
SDL_PumpEvents \- Pump the event loop, gathering events from the input devices\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_events\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_PumpEvents(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function updates the event queue and internal input device state\[char46]
.B WARNING
: This should only be run in the thread that initialized the
video subsystem, and for extra safety, you should consider only doing those
things on the main thread in any case\[char46]


.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() gathers all the pending input
information from devices and places it in the event queue\[char46] Without calls to

.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() no events would ever be placed on the
queue\[char46] Often the need for calls to 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() is
hidden from the user since 
.BR SDL_PollEvent
() and

.BR SDL_WaitEvent
() implicitly call

.BR SDL_PumpEvents
()\[char46] However, if you are not polling or
waiting for events (e\[char46]g\[char46] you are filtering them), then you must call

.BR SDL_PumpEvents
() to force an event queue update\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR SDL_PollEvent (3),
.BR SDL_WaitEvent (3)
