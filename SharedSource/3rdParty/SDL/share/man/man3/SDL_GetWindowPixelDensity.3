.SH NAME
SDL_GetWindowPixelDensity \- Get the pixel density of a window\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "float SDL_GetWindowPixelDensity(SDL_Window *window);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a ratio of pixel size to window size\[char46] For example, if the window is
1920x1080 and it has a high density back buffer of 3840x2160 pixels, it
would have a pixel density of 2\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to query
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the pixel density or 0\[char46]0f on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
