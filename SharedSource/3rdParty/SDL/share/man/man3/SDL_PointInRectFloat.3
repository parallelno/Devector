.TH SDL_PointInRectFloat 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_PointInRectFloat \- Determine whether a point resides inside a floating point rectangle\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_rect\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_FORCE_INLINE SDL_bool SDL_PointInRectFloat(const SDL_FPoint *p, const SDL_FRect *r);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A point is considered part of a rectangle if both
.BR p
and
.BR r
are not NULL,
and
.BR p
's x and y coordinates are >= to the rectangle's top left corner,
and < the rectangle's x+w and y+h\[char46] So a 1x1 rectangle considers point (0,0)
as "inside" and (0,1) as not\[char46]

Note that this is a forced-inline function in a header, and not a public
API function available in the SDL library (which is to say, the code is
embedded in the calling program and the linker and dynamic loader will not
be able to find this function inside SDL itself)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I p
the point to test\[char46]
.TP
.I r
the rectangle to test\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 
.BR SDL_TRUE
 if
.BR p
is contained by
.BR r
,

.BR SDL_FALSE
 otherwise\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
