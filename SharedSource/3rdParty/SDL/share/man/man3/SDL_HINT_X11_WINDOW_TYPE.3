.SH DESCRIPTION
During 
.BR SDL_CreateWindow
, SDL uses the
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 property to report to the window manager the type
of window it wants to create\[char46] This might be set to various things if

.BR SDL_WINDOW_TOOLTIP
 or

.BR SDL_WINDOW_POPUP_MENU
, etc, were specified\[char46] For
"normal" windows that haven't set a specific type, this hint can be used to
specify a custom type\[char46] For example, a dock window might set this to
"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK"\[char46]

This hint should be set before creating a window\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
