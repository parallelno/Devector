.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function unpauses audio processing for a given device that has
previously been paused with 
.BR SDL_PauseAudioDevice
()\[char46]
Once unpaused, any bound audio streams will begin to progress again, and
audio can be generated\[char46]

Unlike in SDL2, audio devices start in an _unpaused_ state, since an app
has to bind a stream before any audio will flow\[char46] Unpausing an unpaused
device is a legal no-op\[char46]

Physical devices can not be paused or unpaused, only logical devices
created through 
.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
() can be\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dev
a device opened by 
.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
()
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
