.SH NAME
SDL_LockTexture \- Lock a portion of the texture for
.B write-only
pixel access\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_render\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_LockTexture(SDL_Texture *texture,
.BI "                    const SDL_Rect *rect,
.BI "                    void **pixels, int *pitch);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data\[char46] This is a write-only operation, and if you
need to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the
application level\[char46]

You must use 
.BR SDL_UnlockTexture
() to unlock the pixels
and apply any changes\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I texture
the texture to lock for access, which was created with 
.BR
.BR SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING

.TP
.I rect
an 
.BR SDL_Rect
 structure representing the area to lock for access; NULL to lock the entire texture
.TP
.I pixels
this is filled in with a pointer to the locked pixels, appropriately offset by the locked area
.TP
.I pitch
this is filled in with the pitch of the locked pixels; the pitch is the length of one row in bytes
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code if the texture is not valid
or was not created with

.BR
.BR SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING
; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
