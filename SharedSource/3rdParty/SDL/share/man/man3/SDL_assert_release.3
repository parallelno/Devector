.SH NAME
SDL_assert_release \- An assertion test that is performed even in release builds\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_assert\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_assert_release(condition) SDL_disabled_assert(condition)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This macro is enabled when the 
.BR SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL
 is >=
1, otherwise it is disabled\[char46] This is meant to be for tests that are cheap
to make and extremely unlikely to fail; generally it is frowned upon to
have an assertion failure in a release build, so these assertions generally
need to be of more than life-and-death importance if there's a chance they
might trigger\[char46] You should almost always consider handling these cases more
gracefully than an assert allows\[char46]

When assertions are disabled, this wraps
.BR condition
in a
.BR sizeof
operator, which means any function calls and side effects will not run, but
the compiler will not complain about any otherwise-unused variables that
are only referenced in the assertion\[char46]

One can set the environment variable "
.BR SDL_ASSERT
" to one of
several strings ("abort", "break", "retry", "ignore", "always_ignore") to
force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes\[char46]
If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but
you're debugging an assertion in a background thread, it might be desirable
to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control as soon as
assert is triggered, instead of risking a bad UI interaction (deadlock,
etc) in the application\[char46]

Note that 
.BR SDL_ASSERT
 is an _environment variable_ and not an
SDL hint! Please refer to your platform's documentation for how to set it!

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
