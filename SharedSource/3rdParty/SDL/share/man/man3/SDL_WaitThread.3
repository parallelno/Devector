.TH SDL_WaitThread 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_WaitThread \- Wait for a thread to finish\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_thread\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_WaitThread(SDL_Thread * thread, int *status);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Threads that haven't been detached will remain (as a "zombie") until this
function cleans them up\[char46] Not doing so is a resource leak\[char46]

Once a thread has been cleaned up through this function, the

.BR SDL_Thread
 that references it becomes invalid and should not
be referenced again\[char46] As such, only one thread may call

.BR SDL_WaitThread
() on another\[char46]

The return code for the thread function is placed in the area pointed to by
.BR status
, if
.BR status
is not NULL\[char46]

You may not wait on a thread that has been used in a call to

.BR SDL_DetachThread
()\[char46] Use either that function or this
one, but not both, or behavior is undefined\[char46]

It is safe to pass a NULL thread to this function; it is a no-op\[char46]

Note that the thread pointer is freed by this function and is not valid
afterward\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I thread
the 
.BR SDL_Thread
 pointer that was returned from the 
.BR SDL_CreateThread
() call that started this thread
.TP
.I status
pointer to an integer that will receive the value returned from the thread function by its 'return', or NULL to not receive such value back\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
