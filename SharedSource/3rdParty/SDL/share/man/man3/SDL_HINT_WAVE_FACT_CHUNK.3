.TH SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK \- A variable controlling how the fact chunk affects the loading of a WAVE file\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK   "SDL_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The fact chunk stores information about the number of samples of a WAVE
file\[char46] The Standards Update from Microsoft notes that this value can be used
to 'determine the length of the data in seconds'\[char46] This is especially useful
for compressed formats (for which this is a mandatory chunk) if they
produce multiple sample frames per block and truncating the block is not
allowed\[char46] The fact chunk can exactly specify how many sample frames there
should be in this case\[char46]

Unfortunately, most application seem to ignore the fact chunk and so SDL
ignores it by default as well\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "truncate" - Use the number of samples to truncate the wave data if the
  fact chunk is present and valid\[char46]

\(bu "strict" - Like "truncate", but raise an error if the fact chunk is
  invalid, not present for non-PCM formats, or if the data chunk doesn't
  have that many samples\[char46]

\(bu "ignorezero" - Like "truncate", but ignore fact chunk if the number of
  samples is zero\[char46]

\(bu "ignore" - Ignore fact chunk entirely\[char46] (default)

This hint should be set before calling 
.BR SDL_LoadWAV
() or

.BR SDL_LoadWAV_IO
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
