.SH DESCRIPTION
The higher resolution the timer, the more frequently the CPU services timer
interrupts, and the more precise delays are, but this takes up power and
CPU time\[char46] This hint is only used on Windows\[char46]

See this blog post for more information:
http://randomascii\[char46]wordpress\[char46]com/2013/07/08/windows-timer-resolution-megawatts-wasted/

The default value is "1"\[char46]

If this variable is set to "0", the system timer resolution is not set\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
