.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_CAMERA_DRIVER "SDL_CAMERA_DRIVER"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, SDL will try all available camera backends in a reasonable
order until it finds one that can work, but this hint allows the app or
user to force a specific target, such as "directshow" if, say, you are on
Windows Media Foundations but want to try DirectShow instead\[char46]

The default value is unset, in which case SDL will try to figure out the
best camera backend on your behalf\[char46] This hint needs to be set before

.BR SDL_Init
() is called to be useful\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
