.SH NAME
SDL_HapticDirection \- Structure that represents a haptic direction\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_haptic\[char46]h

.BI "typedef struct SDL_HapticDirection

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the direction where the force comes from, instead of the direction
in which the force is exerted\[char46]

Directions can be specified by:


\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR
 : Specified by polar coordinates\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN
 : Specified by cartesian
  coordinates\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL
 : Specified by spherical
  coordinates\[char46]

Cardinal directions of the haptic device are relative to the positioning of
the device\[char46] North is considered to be away from the user\[char46]

The following diagram represents the cardinal directions:
.BR

.BR 
If type is 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR
, direction is encoded by
hundredths of a degree starting north and turning clockwise\[char46]

.BR SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR
 only uses the first
.BR dir
parameter\[char46]
The cardinal directions would be:


\(bu North: 0 (0 degrees)

\(bu East: 9000 (90 degrees)

\(bu South: 18000 (180 degrees)

\(bu West: 27000 (270 degrees)

If type is 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN
, direction is
encoded by three positions (X axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes))\[char46]

.BR SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN
 uses the first three
.BR dir
parameters\[char46] The cardinal directions would be:


\(bu North: 0,-1, 0

\(bu East: 1, 0, 0

\(bu South: 0, 1, 0

\(bu West: -1, 0, 0

The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise it's
unused\[char46] In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you can
use any multiple you want, only the direction matters\[char46]

If type is 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL
, direction is
encoded by two rotations\[char46] The first two
.BR dir
parameters are used\[char46] The
.BR dir
parameters are as follows (all values are in hundredths of degrees):


\(bu Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1)\[char46]

\(bu Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes)\[char46]

Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming
from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):
.BR 

.BR c
 SDL_HapticDirection direction;

 // Cartesian directions
 direction\[char46]type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding\[char46]
 direction\[char46]dir[0] = 0; // X position
 direction\[char46]dir[1] = 1; // Y position
 // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter\[char46]

 // Polar directions
 direction\[char46]type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding\[char46]
 direction\[char46]dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter

 // Spherical coordinates
 direction\[char46]type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding
 direction\[char46]dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters\[char46]
