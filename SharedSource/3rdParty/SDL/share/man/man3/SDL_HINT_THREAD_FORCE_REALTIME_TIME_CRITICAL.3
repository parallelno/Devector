.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_THREAD_FORCE_REALTIME_TIME_CRITICAL \- Specifies whether 
.BR SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
 should be treated as realtime\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH DESCRIPTION
On some platforms, like Linux, a realtime priority thread may be subject to
restrictions that require special handling by the application\[char46] This hint
exists to let SDL know that the app is prepared to handle said
restrictions\[char46]

On Linux, SDL will apply the following configuration to any thread that
becomes realtime:


\(bu The SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK bit will be set on the scheduling policy,

\(bu An RLIMIT_RTTIME budget will be configured to the rtkit specified limit\[char46]

\(bu Exceeding this limit will result in the kernel sending SIGKILL to the
  app, refer to the man pages for more information\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": default platform specific behaviour

\(bu "1": Force
  
.BR SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
 to
  a realtime scheduling policy

This hint should be set before calling

.BR SDL_SetThreadPriority
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
