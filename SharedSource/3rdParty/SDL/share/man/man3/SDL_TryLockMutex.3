.SH NAME
SDL_TryLockMutex \- Try to lock a mutex without blocking\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_TryLockMutex(SDL_Mutex *mutex) SDL_TRY_ACQUIRE(0, mutex);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works just like 
.BR SDL_LockMutex
(), but if the mutex is
not available, this function returns

.BR
.BR SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT
immediately\[char46]

This technique is useful if you need exclusive access to a resource but
don't want to wait for it, and will return to it to try again later\[char46]

This function does not fail; if mutex is NULL, it will return 0 immediately
having locked nothing\[char46] If the mutex is valid, this function will always
either lock the mutex and return 0, or return

.BR SDL_MUTEX_TIMEOUT
 and lock nothing\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mutex
the mutex to try to lock
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 or 
.BR
.BR SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO

.BR SDL_UnlockMutex (3)
