.TH SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading \- Try to lock a read/write lock _for reading_ without blocking\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading(SDL_RWLock *rwlock) SDL_TRY_ACQUIRE_SHARED(0, rwlock);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works just like

.BR SDL_LockRWLockForReading
(), but if the rwlock
is not available, then this function returns

.BR
.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEDOUT
immediately\[char46]

This technique is useful if you need access to a resource but don't want to
wait for it, and will return to it to try again later\[char46]

Trying to lock for read-only access can succeed if other threads are
holding read-only locks, as this won't prevent access\[char46]

This function does not fail; if rwlock is NULL, it will return 0
immediately having locked nothing\[char46] If rwlock is valid, this function will
always either lock the rwlock and return 0, or return

.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEOUT
 and lock nothing\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rwlock
the rwlock to try to lock
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 or 
.BR
.BR SDL_RWLOCK_TIMEDOUT

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
