.SH NAME
SDL_LoadWAV \- Loads a WAV from a file path\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_LoadWAV(const char *path, SDL_AudioSpec * spec,
.BI "                Uint8 ** audio_buf, Uint32 * audio_len);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a convenience function that is effectively the same as:
.BR 

.BR c
SDL_LoadWAV_IO(SDL_IOFromFile(path, "rb"), 1, spec, audio_buf, audio_len);


.BR 

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I path
The file path of the WAV file to open\[char46]
.TP
.I spec
A pointer to an 
.BR SDL_AudioSpec
 that will be set to the WAVE data's format details on successful return\[char46]
.TP
.I audio_buf
A pointer filled with the audio data, allocated by the function\[char46]
.TP
.I audio_len
A pointer filled with the length of the audio data buffer in bytes
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success\[char46]
.BR audio_buf
will be filled with a pointer to an
allocated buffer containing the audio data, and
.BR audio_len
is filled with
the length of that audio buffer in bytes\[char46]

This function returns -1 if the \[char46]WAV file cannot be opened, uses an unknown
data format, or is corrupt; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more
information\[char46]

When the application is done with the data returned in
.BR audio_buf
, it
should call 
.BR SDL_free
() to dispose of it\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
