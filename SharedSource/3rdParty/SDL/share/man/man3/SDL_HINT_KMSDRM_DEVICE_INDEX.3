.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL might open something like "/dev/dri/cardNN" to access KMSDRM
functionality, where "NN" is a device index number\[char46] SDL makes a guess at
the best index to use (usually zero), but the app or user can set this hint
to a number between 0 and 99 to force selection\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
