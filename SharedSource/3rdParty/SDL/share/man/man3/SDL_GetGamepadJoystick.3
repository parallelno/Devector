.SH DESCRIPTION
This function will give you a 
.BR SDL_Joystick
 object, which
allows you to use the 
.BR SDL_Joystick
 functions with a

.BR SDL_Gamepad
 object\[char46] This would be useful for getting a
joystick's position at any given time, even if it hasn't moved (moving it
would produce an event, which would have the axis' value)\[char46]

The pointer returned is owned by the 
.BR SDL_Gamepad
\[char46] You should
not call 
.BR SDL_CloseJoystick
() on it, for example, since
doing so will likely cause SDL to crash\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I gamepad
the gamepad object that you want to get a joystick from
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an 
.BR SDL_Joystick
 object; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
