.SH DESCRIPTION
Many OSes provide certain standard folders for certain purposes, such as
storing pictures, music or videos for a certain user\[char46] This function gives
the path for many of those special locations\[char46]

This function is specifically for _user_ folders, which are meant for the
user to access and manage\[char46] For application-specific folders, meant to hold
data for the application to manage, see

.BR SDL_GetBasePath
() and

.BR SDL_GetPrefPath
()\[char46]

Note that the function is expensive, and should be called once at the
beginning of the execution and kept for as long as needed\[char46]

The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\\' on
Windows, '/' on most other platforms)\[char46]

The returned value is owned by the caller and should be freed with

.BR SDL_free
()\[char46]

If NULL is returned, the error may be obtained with

.BR SDL_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I folder
The type of folder to find
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns Either a null-terminated C string containing the full path to the
folder, or NULL if an error happened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
