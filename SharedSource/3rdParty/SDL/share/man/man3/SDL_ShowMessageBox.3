.SH NAME
SDL_ShowMessageBox \- Create a modal message box\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_messagebox\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_ShowMessageBox(const SDL_MessageBoxData *messageboxdata, int *buttonid);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If your needs aren't complex, it might be easier to use

.BR SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox
\[char46]

This function should be called on the thread that created the parent
window, or on the main thread if the messagebox has no parent\[char46] It will
block execution of that thread until the user clicks a button or closes the
messagebox\[char46]

This function may be called at any time, even before

.BR SDL_Init
()\[char46] This makes it useful for reporting errors like a
failure to create a renderer or OpenGL context\[char46]

On X11, SDL rolls its own dialog box with X11 primitives instead of a
formal toolkit like GTK+ or Qt\[char46]

Note that if 
.BR SDL_Init
() would fail because there isn't any
available video target, this function is likely to fail for the same
reasons\[char46] If this is a concern, check the return value from this function
and fall back to writing to stderr if you can\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I messageboxdata
the 
.BR SDL_MessageBoxData
 structure with title, text and other options
.TP
.I buttonid
the pointer to which user id of hit button should be copied
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
