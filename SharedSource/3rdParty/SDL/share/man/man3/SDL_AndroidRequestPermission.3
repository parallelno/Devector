.SH NAME
SDL_AndroidRequestPermission \- Request permissions at runtime, asynchronously\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_system\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_AndroidRequestPermission(const char *permission, SDL_AndroidRequestPermissionCallback cb, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You do not need to call this for built-in functionality of SDL; recording
from a microphone or reading images from a camera, using standard SDL APIs,
will manage permission requests for you\[char46]

This function never blocks\[char46] Instead, the app-supplied callback will be
called when a decision has been made\[char46] This callback may happen on a
different thread, and possibly much later, as it might wait on a user to
respond to a system dialog\[char46] If permission has already been granted for a
specific entitlement, the callback will still fire, probably on the current
thread and before this function returns\[char46]

If the request submission fails, this function returns -1 and the callback
will NOT be called, but this should only happen in catastrophic conditions,
like memory running out\[char46] Normally there will be a yes or no to the request
through the callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I permission
The permission to request\[char46]
.TP
.I cb
The callback to trigger when the request has a response\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
An app-controlled pointer that is passed to the callback\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero if the request was submitted, -1 if there was an error
submitting\[char46] The result of the request is only ever reported through the
callback, not this return value\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
