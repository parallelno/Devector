.SH NAME
SDL_GlobStorageDirectory \- Enumerate a directory tree, filtered by pattern, and return a list\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_storage\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "extern DECLSPEC char **SDLCALL SDL_GlobStorageDirectory(SDL_Storage *storage, const char *path, const char *pattern, Uint32 flags, int *count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files are filtered out if they don't match the string in
.BR pattern
, which
may contain wildcard characters '
.I ' (match everything) and '?' (match one
character)\[char46] If pattern is NULL, no filtering is done and all results are
returned\[char46] Subdirectories are permitted, and are specified with a path
separator of '/'\[char46] Wildcard characters '
' and '?' never match a path
separator\[char46]
.BR flags
may be set to 
.BR SDL_GLOB_CASEINSENSITIVE

to make the pattern matching case-insensitive\[char46]

The returned array is always NULL-terminated, for your iterating
convenience, but if
.BR count
is non-NULL, on return it will contain the
number of items in the array, not counting the NULL terminator\[char46]

You must free the returned pointer with 
.BR SDL_free
() when done
with it\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I storage
a storage container
.TP
.I path
the path of the directory to enumerate
.TP
.I pattern
the pattern that files in the directory must match\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I flags

.BR SDL_GLOB_*
bitflags that affect this search\[char46]
.TP
.I count
on return, will be set to the number of items in the returned array\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an array of strings on success or NULL on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46] The caller should pass
the returned pointer to 
.BR SDL_free
 when done with it\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, assuming the
.BR storage
object is thread-safe\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
