.TH SDL_GetJoystickAxis 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetJoystickAxis \- Get the current state of an axis control on a joystick\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_joystick\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint16 SDL_GetJoystickAxis(SDL_Joystick *joystick, int axis);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL makes no promises about what part of the joystick any given axis refers
to\[char46] Your game should have some sort of configuration UI to let users
specify what each axis should be bound to\[char46] Alternately, SDL's higher-level
Game Controller API makes a great effort to apply order to this lower-level
interface, so you know that a specific axis is the "left thumb stick," etc\[char46]

The value returned by 
.BR SDL_GetJoystickAxis
() is a
signed integer (-32768 to 32767) representing the current position of the
axis\[char46] It may be necessary to impose certain tolerances on these values to
account for jitter\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I joystick
an 
.BR SDL_Joystick
 structure containing joystick information
.TP
.I axis
the axis to query; the axis indices start at index 0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a 16-bit signed integer representing the current position of the
axis or 0 on failure; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more
information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
