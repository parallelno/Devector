.SH DESCRIPTION
This hint lets you specify the application name sent to the OS when
required\[char46] For example, this will often appear in volume control applets for
audio streams, and in lists of applications which are inhibiting the
screensaver\[char46] You should use a string that describes your program ("My Game
2: The Revenge")

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: probably the application's name or "SDL Application" if SDL
doesn't have any better information\[char46]

Note that, for audio streams, this can be overridden with

.BR SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_APP_NAME
\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
