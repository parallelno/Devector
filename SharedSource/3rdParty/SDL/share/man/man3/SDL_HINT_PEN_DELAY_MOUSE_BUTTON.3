.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": The pen reports mouse button press/release immediately when the pen
  button is pressed/released, and the pen tip touching the surface counts
  as left mouse button press\[char46]

\(bu "1": Mouse button presses are sent when the pen first touches the tablet
  (analogously for releases)\[char46] Not pressing a pen button simulates mouse
  button 1, pressing the first pen button simulates mouse button 2 etc\[char46]; it
  is not possible to report multiple buttons as pressed at the same time\[char46]
  (default)

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
