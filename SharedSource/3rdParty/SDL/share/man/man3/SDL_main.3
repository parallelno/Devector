.TH SDL_main 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_main \- An app-supplied function for program entry\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_main(int argc, char *argv[]);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Apps do not directly create this function; they should create a standard
ANSI-C
.BR main
function instead\[char46] If SDL needs to insert some startup code
before
.BR main
runs, or the platform doesn't actually _use_ a function
called "main", SDL will do some macro magic to redefine
.BR main
to

.BR
.BR SDL_main
and provide its own
.BR main
\[char46]

Apps should include
.BR SDL_main\[char46]h
in the same file as their
.BR main
function,
and they should not use that symbol for anything else in that file, as it
might get redefined\[char46]

This function is only provided by the app if it isn't using

.BR SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS
\[char46]

Program startup is a surprisingly complex topic\[char46] Please see
[README/main-functions](README/main-functions), (or
docs/README-main-functions\[char46]md in the source tree) for a more detailed
explanation\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
This is the program entry point\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
