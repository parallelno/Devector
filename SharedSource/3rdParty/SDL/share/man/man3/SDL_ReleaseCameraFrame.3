.SH NAME
SDL_ReleaseCameraFrame \- Release a frame of video acquired from a camera\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_camera\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_ReleaseCameraFrame(SDL_Camera *camera, SDL_Surface *frame);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Let the back-end re-use the internal buffer for camera\[char46]

This function _must_ be called only on surface objects returned by

.BR SDL_AcquireCameraFrame
()\[char46] This function should be
called as quickly as possible after acquisition, as SDL keeps a small FIFO
queue of surfaces for video frames; if surfaces aren't released in a timely
manner, SDL may drop upcoming video frames from the camera\[char46]

If the app needs to keep the surface for a significant time, they should
make a copy of it and release the original\[char46]

The app should not use the surface again after calling this function;
assume the surface is freed and the pointer is invalid\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I camera
opened camera device
.TP
.I frame
The video frame surface to release\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
