.SH DESCRIPTION
If set, this hint will override the expected results for

.BR SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds
() for display
index 0\[char46] Generally you don't want to do this, but this allows an embedded
system to request that some of the screen be reserved for other uses when
paired with a well-behaved application\[char46]

The contents of this hint must be 4 comma-separated integers, the first is
the bounds x, then y, width and height, in that order\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
