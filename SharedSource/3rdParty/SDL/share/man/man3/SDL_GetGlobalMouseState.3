.TH SDL_GetGlobalMouseState 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetGlobalMouseState \- Get the current state of the mouse in relation to the desktop\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mouse\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Uint32 SDL_GetGlobalMouseState(float *x, float *y);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works similarly to 
.BR SDL_GetMouseState
(), but the
coordinates will be reported relative to the top-left of the desktop\[char46] This
can be useful if you need to track the mouse outside of a specific window
and 
.BR SDL_CaptureMouse
() doesn't fit your needs\[char46] For
example, it could be useful if you need to track the mouse while dragging a
window, where coordinates relative to a window might not be in sync at all
times\[char46]

Note: 
.BR SDL_GetMouseState
() returns the mouse position
as SDL understands it from the last pump of the event queue\[char46] This function,
however, queries the OS for the current mouse position, and as such, might
be a slightly less efficient function\[char46] Unless you know what you're doing
and have a good reason to use this function, you probably want

.BR SDL_GetMouseState
() instead\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I x
filled in with the current X coord relative to the desktop; can be NULL
.TP
.I y
filled in with the current Y coord relative to the desktop; can be NULL
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current button state as a bitmask which can be tested using the

.BR SDL_BUTTON
(X) macros\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
