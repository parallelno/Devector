.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, SDL will try all available audio backends in a reasonable order
until it finds one that can work, but this hint allows the app or user to
force a specific driver, such as "pipewire" if, say, you are on PulseAudio
but want to try talking to the lower level instead\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
