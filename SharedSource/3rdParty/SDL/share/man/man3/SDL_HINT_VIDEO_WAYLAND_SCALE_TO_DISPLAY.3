.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_SCALE_TO_DISPLAY \- A variable forcing non-DPI-aware Wayland windows to output at 1:1 scaling\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
When this hint is set, Wayland windows that are not flagged as being
DPI-aware will be output with scaling designed to force 1:1 pixel mapping\[char46]

This is intended to allow legacy applications to be displayed without
desktop scaling being applied, and has issues with certain display
configurations, as this forces the window to behave in a way that Wayland
desktops were not designed to accommodate:


\(bu Rounding errors can result with odd window sizes and/or desktop scales\[char46]

\(bu The window may be unusably small\[char46]

\(bu The window may jump in size at times\[char46]

\(bu The window may appear to be larger than the desktop size to the
  application\[char46]

\(bu Possible loss of cursor precision\[char46]

New applications should be designed with proper DPI awareness handling
instead of enabling this\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Windows will be scaled normally\[char46]

\(bu "1": Windows will be forced to scale to achieve 1:1 output\[char46]

This hint should be set before creating a window\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
