.SH DESCRIPTION
This is necessary for the right mouse button to work on some Android
devices, or to be able to trap the back button for use in your code
reliably\[char46] If this hint is true, the back button will show up as an

.BR SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN
 /

.BR SDL_EVENT_KEY_UP
 pair with a keycode of

.BR SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK
\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Back button will be handled as usual for system\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Back button will be trapped, allowing you to handle the key press
  manually\[char46] (This will also let right mouse click work on systems where the
  right mouse button functions as back\[char46])

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
