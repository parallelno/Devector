.TH SDL_PutAudioStreamData 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_PutAudioStreamData \- Add data to the stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_PutAudioStreamData(SDL_AudioStream *stream, const void *buf, int len);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This data must match the format/channels/samplerate specified in the latest
call to 
.BR SDL_SetAudioStreamFormat
, or the format
specified when creating the stream if it hasn't been changed\[char46]

Note that this call simply copies the unconverted data for later\[char46] This is
different than SDL2, where data was converted during the Put call and the
Get call would just dequeue the previously-converted data\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
The stream the audio data is being added to
.TP
.I buf
A pointer to the audio data to add
.TP
.I len
The number of bytes to write to the stream
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, but if the stream has a
callback set, the caller might need to manage extra locking\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
