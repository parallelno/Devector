.TH SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued \- Get the number of bytes currently queued\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetAudioStreamQueued(SDL_AudioStream *stream);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Note that audio streams can change their input format at any time, even if
there is still data queued in a different format, so the returned byte
count will not necessarily match the number of _sample frames_ available\[char46]
Users of this API should be aware of format changes they make when feeding
a stream and plan accordingly\[char46]

Queued data is not converted until it is consumed by

.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
, so this value should be
representative of the exact data that was put into the stream\[char46]

If the stream has so much data that it would overflow an int, the return
value is clamped to a maximum value, but no queued data is lost; if there
are gigabytes of data queued, the app might need to read some of it with

.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
 before this function's
return value is no longer clamped\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
The audio stream to query
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes queued\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
