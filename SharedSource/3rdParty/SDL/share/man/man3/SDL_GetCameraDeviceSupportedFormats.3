.SH NAME
SDL_GetCameraDeviceSupportedFormats \- Get the list of native formats/sizes a camera supports\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_camera\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_CameraSpec* SDL_GetCameraDeviceSupportedFormats(SDL_CameraDeviceID devid, int *count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This returns a list of all formats and frame sizes that a specific camera
can offer\[char46] This is useful if your app can accept a variety of image formats
and sizes and so want to find the optimal spec that doesn't require
conversion\[char46]

This function isn't strictly required; if you call

.BR SDL_OpenCameraDevice
 with a NULL spec, SDL will
choose a native format for you, and if you instead specify a desired
format, it will transparently convert to the requested format on your
behalf\[char46]

If
.BR count
is not NULL, it will be filled with the number of elements in
the returned array\[char46] Additionally, the last element of the array has all
fields set to zero (this element is not included in
.BR count
)\[char46]

The returned list is owned by the caller, and should be released with

.BR SDL_free
() when no longer needed\[char46]

Note that it's legal for a camera to supply a list with only the zeroed
final element and
.BR *count
set to zero; this is what will happen on
Emscripten builds, since that platform won't tell _anything_ about
available cameras until you've opened one, and won't even tell if there
_is_ a camera until the user has given you permission to check through a
scary warning popup\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I devid
the camera device instance ID to query\[char46]
.TP
.I count
a pointer filled in with the number of elements in the list\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a 0 terminated array of 
.BR SDL_CameraSpecs
, which
should be freed with 
.BR SDL_free
(), or NULL on error; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
