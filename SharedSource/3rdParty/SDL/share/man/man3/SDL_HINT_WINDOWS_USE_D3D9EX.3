.SH DESCRIPTION
Direct3D 9Ex contains changes to state management that can eliminate device
loss errors during scenarios like Alt+Tab or UAC prompts\[char46] D3D9Ex may
require some changes to your application to cope with the new behavior, so
this is disabled by default\[char46]

For more information on Direct3D 9Ex, see:


\(bu https://docs\[char46]microsoft\[char46]com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/graphics-apis-in-windows-vista#direct3d-9ex

\(bu https://docs\[char46]microsoft\[char46]com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/direct3d-9ex-improvements

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Use the original Direct3D 9 API\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Use the Direct3D 9Ex API on Vista and later (and fall back if D3D9Ex
  is unavailable)

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
