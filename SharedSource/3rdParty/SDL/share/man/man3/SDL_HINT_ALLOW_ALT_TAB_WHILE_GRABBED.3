.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, SDL emulates Alt+Tab functionality while the keyboard is
grabbed and your window is full-screen\[char46] This prevents the user from getting
stuck in your application if you've enabled keyboard grab\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": SDL will not handle Alt+Tab\[char46] Your application is responsible for
  handling Alt+Tab while the keyboard is grabbed\[char46]

\(bu "1": SDL will minimize your window when Alt+Tab is pressed (default)

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
