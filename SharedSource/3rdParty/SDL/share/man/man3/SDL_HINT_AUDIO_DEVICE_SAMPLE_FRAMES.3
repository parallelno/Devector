.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_SAMPLE_FRAMES \- A variable controlling device buffer size\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH DESCRIPTION
This hint is an integer > 0, that represents the size of the device's
buffer in sample frames (stereo audio data in 16-bit format is 4 bytes per
sample frame, for example)\[char46]

SDL3 generally decides this value on behalf of the app, but if for some
reason the app needs to dictate this (because they want either lower
latency or higher throughput AND ARE WILLING TO DEAL WITH what that might
require of the app), they can specify it\[char46]

SDL will try to accomodate this value, but there is no promise you'll get
the buffer size requested\[char46] Many platforms won't honor this request at all,
or might adjust it\[char46]

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
