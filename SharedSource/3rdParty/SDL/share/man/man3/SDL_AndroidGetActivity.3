.SH DESCRIPTION
The prototype of the function in SDL's code actually declares a void*
return type, even if the implementation returns a jobject\[char46] The rationale
being that the SDL headers can avoid including jni\[char46]h\[char46]

The jobject returned by the function is a local reference and must be
released by the caller\[char46] See the PushLocalFrame() and PopLocalFrame() or
DeleteLocalRef() functions of the Java native interface:

Android application, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
