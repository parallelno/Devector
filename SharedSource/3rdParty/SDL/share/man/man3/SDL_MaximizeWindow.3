.SH NAME
SDL_MaximizeWindow \- Request that the window be made as large as possible\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_MaximizeWindow(SDL_Window *window);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Non-resizable windows can't be maximized\[char46] The window must have the

.BR SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE
 flag set, or this will have no
effect\[char46]

On some windowing systems this request is asynchronous and the new window
state may not have have been applied immediately upon the return of this
function\[char46] If an immediate change is required, call

.BR SDL_SyncWindow
() to block until the changes have taken
effect\[char46]

When the window state changes, an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_MAXIMIZED
 event will be
emitted\[char46] Note that, as this is just a request, the windowing system can
deny the state change\[char46]

When maximizing a window, whether the constraints set via

.BR SDL_SetWindowMaximumSize
() are honored depends
on the policy of the window manager\[char46] Win32 and macOS enforce the
constraints when maximizing, while X11 and Wayland window managers may
vary\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to maximize
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
