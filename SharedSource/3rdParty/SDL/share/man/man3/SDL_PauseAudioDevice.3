.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function pauses audio processing for a given device\[char46] Any bound audio
streams will not progress, and no audio will be generated\[char46] Pausing one
device does not prevent other unpaused devices from running\[char46]

Unlike in SDL2, audio devices start in an _unpaused_ state, since an app
has to bind a stream before any audio will flow\[char46] Pausing a paused device is
a legal no-op\[char46]

Pausing a device can be useful to halt all audio without unbinding all the
audio streams\[char46] This might be useful while a game is paused, or a level is
loading, etc\[char46]

Physical devices can not be paused or unpaused, only logical devices
created through 
.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
() can be\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dev
a device opened by 
.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
()
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.SH THREAD SAFETY
