.SH NAME
SDL_GUID \- An 
.BR SDL_GUID
 is a 128-bit identifier for an input device that identifies that device across runs of SDL programs on the same platform\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_guid\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "typedef struct SDL_GUID {
.BI "    Uint8 data[16];
.BI "} SDL_GUID;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the device is detached and then re-attached to a different port, or if
the base system is rebooted, the device should still report the same GUID\[char46]

GUIDs are as precise as possible but are not guaranteed to distinguish
physically distinct but equivalent devices\[char46] For example, two game
controllers from the same vendor with the same product ID and revision may
have the same GUID\[char46]

GUIDs may be platform-dependent (i\[char46]e\[char46], the same device may report different
GUIDs on different operating systems)\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
