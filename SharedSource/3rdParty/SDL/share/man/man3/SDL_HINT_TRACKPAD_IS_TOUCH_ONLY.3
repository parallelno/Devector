.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
On macOS (and possibly other platforms in the future), SDL will report
touches on a trackpad as mouse input, which is generally what users expect
from this device; however, these are often actually full multitouch-capable
touch devices, so it might be preferable to some apps to treat them as
such\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Trackpad will send mouse events\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Trackpad will send touch events\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
