.SH NAME
SDL_SetWindowPosition \- Request that the window's position be set\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetWindowPosition(SDL_Window *window, int x, int y);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If, at the time of this request, the window is in a fixed-size state such
as maximized, this request may be deferred until the window returns to a
resizable state\[char46]

This can be used to reposition fullscreen-desktop windows onto a different
display, however, exclusive fullscreen windows are locked to a specific
display and can only be repositioned programmatically via

.BR SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode
()\[char46]

On some windowing systems this request is asynchronous and the new
coordinates may not have have been applied immediately upon the return of
this function\[char46] If an immediate change is required, call

.BR SDL_SyncWindow
() to block until the changes have taken
effect\[char46]

When the window position changes, an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_MOVED
 event will be emitted with
the window's new coordinates\[char46] Note that the new coordinates may not match
the exact coordinates requested, as some windowing systems can restrict the
position of the window in certain scenarios (e\[char46]g\[char46] constraining the position
so the window is always within desktop bounds)\[char46] Additionally, as this is
just a request, it can be denied by the windowing system\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to reposition
.TP
.I x
the x coordinate of the window, or 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED
or 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED

.TP
.I y
the y coordinate of the window, or 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED
or 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
