.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_RENDER_LINE_METHOD \- A variable controlling how the 2D render API renders lines\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_RENDER_LINE_METHOD "SDL_RENDER_LINE_METHOD"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Use the default line drawing method (Bresenham's line algorithm)

\(bu "1": Use the driver point API using Bresenham's line algorithm (correct,
  draws many points)

\(bu "2": Use the driver line API (occasionally misses line endpoints based on
  hardware driver quirks

\(bu "3": Use the driver geometry API (correct, draws thicker diagonal lines)

This hint should be set before creating a renderer\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
