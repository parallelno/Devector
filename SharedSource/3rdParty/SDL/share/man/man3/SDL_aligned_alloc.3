.PP
.BI "SDL_MALLOC void* SDL_aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.BR alignment
is less than the size of
.BR void *
, then it will be increased
to match that\[char46]

The returned memory address will be a multiple of the alignment value, and
the amount of memory allocated will be a multiple of the alignment value\[char46]

The memory returned by this function must be freed with

.BR SDL_aligned_free
()

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I alignment

.TP
.I size
the size to allocate
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to the aligned memory
