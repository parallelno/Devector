.SH NAME
SDL_IOFromDynamicMem \- Use this function to create an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 that is backed by dynamically allocated memory\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_iostream\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_IOStream* SDL_IOFromDynamicMem(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This supports the following properties to provide access to the memory and
control over allocations: -

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_POINTER
:
a pointer to the internal memory of the stream\[char46] This can be set to NULL to
transfer ownership of the memory to the application, which should free the
memory with 
.BR SDL_free
()\[char46] If this is done, the next operation on
the stream must be 
.BR SDL_CloseIO
()\[char46] -

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_CHUNKSIZE_NUMBER
:
memory will be allocated in multiples of this size, defaulting to 1024\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to a new 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 structure, or NULL
if it fails; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
