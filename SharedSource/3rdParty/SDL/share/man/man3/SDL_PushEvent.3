.SH NAME
SDL_PushEvent \- Add an event to the event queue\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_events\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_PushEvent(SDL_Event *event);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The event queue can actually be used as a two way communication channel\[char46]
Not only can events be read from the queue, but the user can also push
their own events onto it\[char46]
.BR event
is a pointer to the event structure you
wish to push onto the queue\[char46] The event is copied into the queue, and the
caller may dispose of the memory pointed to after

.BR SDL_PushEvent
() returns\[char46]

Note: Pushing device input events onto the queue doesn't modify the state
of the device within SDL\[char46]

This function is thread-safe, and can be called from other threads safely\[char46]

Note: Events pushed onto the queue with 
.BR SDL_PushEvent
()
get passed through the event filter but events added with

.BR SDL_PeepEvents
() do not\[char46]

For pushing application-specific events, please use

.BR SDL_RegisterEvents
() to get an event type that does
not conflict with other code that also wants its own custom event types\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I event
the 
.BR SDL_Event
 to be added to the queue
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 1 on success, 0 if the event was filtered, or a negative error code
on failure; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46] A
common reason for error is the event queue being full\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
