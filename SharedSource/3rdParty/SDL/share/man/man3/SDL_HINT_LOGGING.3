.SH DESCRIPTION
This variable is a comma separated set of category=level tokens that define
the default logging levels for SDL applications\[char46]

The category can be a numeric category, one of "app", "error", "assert",
"system", "audio", "video", "render", "input", "test", or
.BR
.I 
for any
unspecified category\[char46]

The level can be a numeric level, one of "verbose", "debug", "info",
"warn", "error", "critical", or "quiet" to disable that category\[char46]

You can omit the category if you want to set the logging level for all
categories\[char46]

If this hint isn't set, the default log levels are equivalent to:
.BR app=info,assert=warn,test=verbose,
=error
This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
