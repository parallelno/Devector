.SH NAME
SDL_WriteIO \- Write to an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 data stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_iostream\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "size_t SDL_WriteIO(SDL_IOStream *context, const void *ptr, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function writes exactly
.BR size
bytes from the area pointed at by
.BR ptr
to the stream\[char46] If this fails for any reason, it'll return less than
.BR size
to demonstrate how far the write progressed\[char46] On success, it returns
.BR size
\[char46]

On error, this function still attempts to write as much as possible, so it
might return a positive value less than the requested write size\[char46]

The caller can use 
.BR SDL_GetIOStatus
() to determine if the
problem is recoverable, such as a non-blocking write that can simply be
retried later, or a fatal error\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I context
a pointer to an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 structure
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to a buffer containing data to write
.TP
.I size
the number of bytes to write
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes written, which will be less than
.BR size
on
error; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
