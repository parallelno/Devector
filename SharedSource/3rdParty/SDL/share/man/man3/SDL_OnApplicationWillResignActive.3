.SH DESCRIPTION
This functions allows iOS apps that have their own event handling to hook
into SDL to generate SDL events\[char46] This maps directly to an iOS-specific
event, but since it doesn't do anything iOS-specific internally, it is
available on all platforms, in case it might be useful for some specific
paradigm\[char46] Most apps do not need to use this directly; SDL's internal event
code will handle all this for windows created by

.BR SDL_CreateWindow
!

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
