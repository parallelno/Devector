.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION \- A variable controlling how a truncated WAVE file is handled\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION   "SDL_WAVE_TRUNCATION"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A WAVE file is considered truncated if any of the chunks are incomplete or
the data chunk size is not a multiple of the block size\[char46] By default, SDL
decodes until the first incomplete block, as most applications seem to do\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "verystrict" - Raise an error if the file is truncated\[char46]

\(bu "strict" - Like "verystrict", but the size of the RIFF chunk is ignored\[char46]

\(bu "dropframe" - Decode until the first incomplete sample frame\[char46]

\(bu "dropblock" - Decode until the first incomplete block\[char46] (default)

This hint should be set before calling 
.BR SDL_LoadWAV
() or

.BR SDL_LoadWAV_IO
()

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
