.SH DESCRIPTION
This struct is exclusively for the 
.BR SDL_HAPTIC_RAMP

effect\[char46]

The ramp effect starts at start strength and ends at end strength\[char46] It
augments in linear fashion\[char46] If you use attack and fade with a ramp the
effects get added to the ramp effect making the effect become quadratic
instead of linear\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
