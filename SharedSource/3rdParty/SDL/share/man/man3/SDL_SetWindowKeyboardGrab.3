.SH NAME
SDL_SetWindowKeyboardGrab \- Set a window's keyboard grab mode\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_SetWindowKeyboardGrab(SDL_Window *window, SDL_bool grabbed);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Keyboard grab enables capture of system keyboard shortcuts like Alt+Tab or
the Meta/Super key\[char46] Note that not all system keyboard shortcuts can be
captured by applications (one example is Ctrl+Alt+Del on Windows)\[char46]

This is primarily intended for specialized applications such as VNC clients
or VM frontends\[char46] Normal games should not use keyboard grab\[char46]

When keyboard grab is enabled, SDL will continue to handle Alt+Tab when the
window is full-screen to ensure the user is not trapped in your
application\[char46] If you have a custom keyboard shortcut to exit fullscreen
mode, you may suppress this behavior with

.BR
.BR SDL_HINT_ALLOW_ALT_TAB_WHILE_GRABBED
\[char46]

If the caller enables a grab while another window is currently grabbed, the
other window loses its grab in favor of the caller's window\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
The window for which the keyboard grab mode should be set\[char46]
.TP
.I grabbed
This is 
.BR SDL_TRUE
 to grab keyboard, and 
.BR SDL_FALSE
 to release\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
