.SH NAME
SDL_assert_always \- An assertion test that always performed\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_assert\[char46]h

.PP
.BI "#define SDL_assert_always(condition) SDL_enabled_assert(condition)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This macro is always enabled no matter what

.BR SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL
 is set to\[char46] You almost never want to
use this, as it could trigger on an end-user's system, crashing your
program\[char46]

One can set the environment variable "
.BR SDL_ASSERT
" to one of
several strings ("abort", "break", "retry", "ignore", "always_ignore") to
force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes\[char46]
If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but
you're debugging an assertion in a background thread, it might be desirable
to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control as soon as
assert is triggered, instead of risking a bad UI interaction (deadlock,
etc) in the application\[char46]

Note that 
.BR SDL_ASSERT
 is an _environment variable_ and not an
SDL hint! Please refer to your platform's documentation for how to set it!

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
