.SH NAME
SDL_strncmp \- Compare two UTF-8 strings up to a number of bytes\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_strncmp(const char *str1, const char *str2, size_t maxlen);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Due to the nature of UTF-8 encoding, this will work with Unicode strings,
since effectively this function just compares bytes until it hits a
null-terminating character\[char46] Also due to the nature of UTF-8, this can be
used with 
.BR SDL_qsort
() to put strings in (roughly) alphabetical
order\[char46]

Note that while this function is intended to be used with UTF-8, it is
doing a bytewise comparison, and
.BR maxlen
specifies a _byte_ limit! If the
limit lands in the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence, it will only
compare a portion of the final character\[char46]
.BR maxlen
specifies a maximum number of bytes to compare; if the strings
match to this number of bytes (or both have matched to a null-terminator
character before this number of bytes), they will be considered equal\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I str1
The first string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.TP
.I str2
The second string to compare\[char46] NULL is not permitted!
.TP
.I maxlen
The maximum number of _bytes_ to compare\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns less than zero if str1 is "less than" str2, greater than zero if
str1 is "greater than" str2, and zero if the strings match exactly\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
