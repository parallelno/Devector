.SH NAME
SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval \- Set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(int interval);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some systems allow specifying -1 for the interval, to enable adaptive
vsync\[char46] Adaptive vsync works the same as vsync, but if you've already missed
the vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which
might be less jarring for the user during occasional framerate drops\[char46] If an
application requests adaptive vsync and the system does not support it,
this function will fail and return -1\[char46] In such a case, you should probably
retry the call with 1 for the interval\[char46]

Adaptive vsync is implemented for some glX drivers with
GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear, and for some Windows drivers with
WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear\[char46]
