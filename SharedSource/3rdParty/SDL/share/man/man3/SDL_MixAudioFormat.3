.SH NAME
SDL_MixAudioFormat \- Mix audio data in a specified format\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_MixAudioFormat(Uint8 * dst,
.BI "                       const Uint8 * src,
.BI "                       SDL_AudioFormat format,
.BI "                       Uint32 len, int volume);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This takes an audio buffer
.BR src
of
.BR len
bytes of
.BR format
data and mixes
it into
.BR dst
, performing addition, volume adjustment, and overflow
clipping\[char46] The buffer pointed to by
.BR dst
must also be
.BR len
bytes of
.BR format
data\[char46]

This is provided for convenience -- you can mix your own audio data\[char46]

Do not use this function for mixing together more than two streams of
sample data\[char46] The output from repeated application of this function may be
distorted by clipping, because there is no accumulator with greater range
than the input (not to mention this being an inefficient way of doing it)\[char46]

It is a common misconception that this function is required to write audio
data to an output stream in an audio callback\[char46] While you can do that,

.BR SDL_MixAudioFormat
() is really only needed when
you're mixing a single audio stream with a volume adjustment\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dst
the destination for the mixed audio
.TP
.I src
the source audio buffer to be mixed
.TP
.I format
the 
.BR SDL_AudioFormat
 structure representing the desired audio format
.TP
.I len
the length of the audio buffer in bytes
.TP
.I volume
ranges from 0 - 128, and should be set to 
.BR SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME
 for full audio volume
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
