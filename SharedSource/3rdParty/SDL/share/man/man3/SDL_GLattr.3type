.SH DESCRIPTION
While you can set most OpenGL attributes normally, the attributes listed
above must be known before SDL creates the window that will be used with
the OpenGL context\[char46] These attributes are set and read with

.BR SDL_GL_SetAttribute
() and

.BR SDL_GL_GetAttribute
()\[char46]

In some cases, these attributes are minimum requests; the GL does not
promise to give you exactly what you asked for\[char46] It's possible to ask for a
16-bit depth buffer and get a 24-bit one instead, for example, or to ask
for no stencil buffer and still have one available\[char46] Context creation should
fail if the GL can't provide your requested attributes at a minimum, but
you should check to see exactly what you got\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
