.SH DESCRIPTION
The accelerometer returns the current acceleration in SI meters per second
squared\[char46] This measurement includes the force of gravity, so a device at
rest will have an value of 
.BR SDL_STANDARD_GRAVITY

away from the center of the earth, which is a positive Y value\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
