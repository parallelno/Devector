.TH SDL_LockTextureToSurface 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_LockTextureToSurface \- Lock a portion of the texture for
.B write-only
pixel access, and expose it as a SDL surface\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_render\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_LockTextureToSurface(SDL_Texture *texture,
.BI "                    const SDL_Rect *rect,
.BI "                    SDL_Surface **surface);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Besides providing an 
.BR SDL_Surface
 instead of raw pixel data,
this function operates like 
.BR SDL_LockTexture
\[char46]

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data\[char46] This is a write-only operation, and if you
need to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the
application level\[char46]

You must use 
.BR SDL_UnlockTexture
() to unlock the pixels
and apply any changes\[char46]

The returned surface is freed internally after calling

.BR SDL_UnlockTexture
() or

.BR SDL_DestroyTexture
()\[char46] The caller should not free it\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I texture
the texture to lock for access, which must be created with 
.BR
.BR SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING

.TP
.I rect
a pointer to the rectangle to lock for access\[char46] If the rect is NULL, the entire texture will be locked
.TP
.I surface
this is filled in with an SDL surface representing the locked area
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
