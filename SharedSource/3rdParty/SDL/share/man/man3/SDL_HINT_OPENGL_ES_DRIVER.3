.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_OPENGL_ES_DRIVER \- A variable controlling what driver to use for OpenGL ES contexts\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH DESCRIPTION
On some platforms, currently Windows and X11, OpenGL drivers may support
creating contexts with an OpenGL ES profile\[char46] By default SDL uses these
profiles, when available, otherwise it attempts to load an OpenGL ES
library, e\[char46]g\[char46] that provided by the ANGLE project\[char46] This variable controls
whether SDL follows this default behaviour or will always load an OpenGL ES
library\[char46]

Circumstances where this is useful include - Testing an app with a
particular OpenGL ES implementation, e\[char46]g ANGLE, or emulator, e\[char46]g\[char46] those
from ARM, Imagination or Qualcomm\[char46] - Resolving OpenGL ES function addresses
at link time by linking with the OpenGL ES library instead of querying them
at run time with 
.BR SDL_GL_GetProcAddress
()\[char46]

Caution: for an application to work with the default behaviour across
different OpenGL drivers it must query the OpenGL ES function addresses at
run time using 
.BR SDL_GL_GetProcAddress
()\[char46]

This variable is ignored on most platforms because OpenGL ES is native or
not supported\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Use ES profile of OpenGL, if available\[char46] (default)

\(bu "1": Load OpenGL ES library using the default library names\[char46]

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
