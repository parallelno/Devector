.SH DESCRIPTION
Some audio backends (such as PulseAudio) allow you to describe your audio
stream\[char46] Among other things, this description might show up in a system
control panel that lets the user adjust the volume on specific audio
streams instead of using one giant master volume slider\[char46]

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS\[char46] The contents of
this hint are used while opening an audio device\[char46] You should use a string
that describes your program ("My Game 2: The Revenge")

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: this will be the name set with

.BR SDL_HINT_APP_NAME
, if that hint is set\[char46] Otherwise,
it'll probably the application's name or "SDL Application" if SDL doesn't
have any better information\[char46]

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
