.SH NAME
SDL_BindAudioStreams \- Bind a list of audio streams to an audio device\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_BindAudioStreams(SDL_AudioDeviceID devid, SDL_AudioStream **streams, int num_streams);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Audio data will flow through any bound streams\[char46] For an output device, data
for all bound streams will be mixed together and fed to the device\[char46] For a
capture device, a copy of recorded data will be provided to each bound
stream\[char46]

Audio streams can only be bound to an open device\[char46] This operation is
atomic--all streams bound in the same call will start processing at the
same time, so they can stay in sync\[char46] Also: either all streams will be bound
or none of them will be\[char46]

It is an error to bind an already-bound stream; it must be explicitly
unbound first\[char46]

Binding a stream to a device will set its output format for output devices,
and its input format for capture devices, so they match the device's
settings\[char46] The caller is welcome to change the other end of the stream's
format at any time\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I devid
an audio device to bind a stream to\[char46]
.TP
.I streams
an array of audio streams to unbind\[char46]
.TP
.I num_streams
Number streams listed in the
.BR streams
array\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, -1 on error; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for
more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
