.SH NAME
SDL_GetWindowBordersSize \- Get the size of a window's borders (decorations) around the client area\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_video\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetWindowBordersSize(SDL_Window *window, int *top, int *left, int *bottom, int *right);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Note: If this function fails (returns -1), the size values will be
initialized to 0, 0, 0, 0 (if a non-NULL pointer is provided), as if the
window in question was borderless\[char46]

Note: This function may fail on systems where the window has not yet been
decorated by the display server (for example, immediately after calling

.BR SDL_CreateWindow
)\[char46] It is recommended that you wait at
least until the window has been presented and composited, so that the
window system has a chance to decorate the window and provide the border
dimensions to SDL\[char46]

This function also returns -1 if getting the information is not supported\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I window
the window to query the size values of the border (decorations) from
