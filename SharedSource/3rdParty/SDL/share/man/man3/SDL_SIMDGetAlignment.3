.SH NAME
SDL_SIMDGetAlignment \- Report the alignment this system needs for SIMD allocations\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_cpuinfo\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "size_t SDL_SIMDGetAlignment(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will return the minimum number of bytes to which a pointer must be
aligned to be compatible with SIMD instructions on the current machine\[char46] For
example, if the machine supports SSE only, it will return 16, but if it
supports AVX-512F, it'll return 64 (etc)\[char46] This only reports values for
instruction sets SDL knows about, so if your SDL build doesn't have

.BR SDL_HasAVX512F
(), then it might return 16 for the SSE
support it sees and not 64 for the AVX-512 instructions that exist but SDL
doesn't know about\[char46] Plan accordingly\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the alignment in bytes needed for available, known SIMD
instructions\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
