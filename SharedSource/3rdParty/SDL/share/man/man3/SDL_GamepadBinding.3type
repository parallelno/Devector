.SH DESCRIPTION
A gamepad has a collection of several bindings, to say, for example, when
joystick button number 5 is pressed, that should be treated like the
gamepad's "start" button\[char46]

SDL has these bindings built-in for many popular controllers, and can add
more with a simple text string\[char46] Those strings are parsed into a collection
of these structs to make it easier to operate on the data\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
