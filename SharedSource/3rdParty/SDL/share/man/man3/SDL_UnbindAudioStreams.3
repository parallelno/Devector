.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_UnbindAudioStreams(SDL_AudioStream **streams, int num_streams);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The streams being unbound do not all have to be on the same device\[char46] All
streams on the same device will be unbound atomically (data will stop
flowing through all unbound streams on the same device at the same time)\[char46]

Unbinding a stream that isn't bound to a device is a legal no-op\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I streams
an array of audio streams to unbind\[char46]
.TP
.I num_streams
Number streams listed in the
.BR streams
array\[char46]
.SH THREAD SAFETY
