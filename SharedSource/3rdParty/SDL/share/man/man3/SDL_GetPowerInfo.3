.SH NAME
SDL_GetPowerInfo \- Get the current power supply details\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_power\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_PowerState SDL_GetPowerInfo(int *seconds, int *percent);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You should never take a battery status as absolute truth\[char46] Batteries
(especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports\[char46] It's
not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it
reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc\[char46]

Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power
state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes
until they seem to be stable for a few seconds\[char46]

It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left
but not both\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I seconds
a pointer filled in with the seconds of battery life left, or NULL to ignore\[char46] This will be filled in with -1 if we can't determine a value or there is no battery\[char46]
.TP
.I percent
a pointer filled in with the percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100, or NULL to ignore\[char46] This will be filled in with -1 we can't determine a value or there is no battery\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current battery state or

.BR
.BR SDL_POWERSTATE_ERROR
on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
