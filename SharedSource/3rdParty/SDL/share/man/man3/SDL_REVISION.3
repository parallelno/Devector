.TH SDL_REVISION 3 "SDL 3.1.2" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_REVISION \- This macro is a string describing the source at a particular point in development\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_revision\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_REVISION "Some arbitrary string decided at SDL build time"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This string is often generated from revision control's state at build time\[char46]

This string can be quite complex and does not follow any standard\[char46] For
example, it might be something like "SDL-prerelease-3\[char46]1\[char46]1-47-gf687e0732"\[char46]
It might also be user-defined at build time, so it's best to treat it as a
clue in debugging forensics and not something the app will parse in any
way\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This macro is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
