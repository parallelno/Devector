.SH NAME
SDL_GetError \- Retrieve a message about the last error that occurred on the current thread\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_error\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "const char* SDL_GetError(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
It is possible for multiple errors to occur before calling

.BR SDL_GetError
()\[char46] Only the last error is returned\[char46]

The message is only applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error\[char46]
You must check the return values of SDL function calls to determine when to
appropriately call 
.BR SDL_GetError
()\[char46] You should
.I not
use the
results of 
.BR SDL_GetError
() to decide if an error has
occurred! Sometimes SDL will set an error string even when reporting
success\[char46]

SDL will
.I not
clear the error string for successful API calls\[char46] You
.I must
check return values for failure cases before you can assume the error
string applies\[char46]

Error strings are set per-thread, so an error set in a different thread
will not interfere with the current thread's operation\[char46]

The returned string is internally allocated and must not be freed by the
application\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a message with information about the specific error that occurred,
or an empty string if there hasn't been an error message set since the last
call to 
.BR SDL_ClearError
()\[char46] The message is only applicable
when an SDL function has signaled an error\[char46] You must check the return
values of SDL function calls to determine when to appropriately call

.BR SDL_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
