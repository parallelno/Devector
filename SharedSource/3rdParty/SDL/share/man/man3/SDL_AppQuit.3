.SH NAME
SDL_AppQuit \- App-implemented deinit entry point for 
.BR SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS
 apps\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_AppQuit(void *appstate);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Apps implement this function when using

.BR SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS
\[char46] If using a standard
"main" function, you should not supply this\[char46]

This function is called once by SDL before terminating the program\[char46]

This function will be called no matter what, even if

.BR SDL_AppInit
 requests termination\[char46]

This function should not go into an infinite mainloop; it should
deinitialize any resources necessary, perform whatever shutdown activities,
and return\[char46]

You do not need to call 
.BR SDL_Quit
() in this function, as SDL
will call it after this function returns and before the process terminates,
but it is safe to do so\[char46]

The
.BR appstate
parameter is an optional pointer provided by the app during

.BR SDL_AppInit
()\[char46] If the app never provided a pointer, this
will be NULL\[char46] This function call is the last time this pointer will be
provided, so any resources to it should be cleaned up here\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I appstate
an optional pointer, provided by the app in 
.BR SDL_AppInit
\[char46]
.SH THREAD SAFETY
This function is not thread safe\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR SDL_AppInit (3)
